    "# TV Script Generation\n",
    "In this project, you'll generate your own [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).\n",

(TO BARFLIES) Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Listen you little puke. One of these days I\\'m gonna catch you, and I\\'m gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s the matter Homer? You\\'re not your normal effervescent self.\\nHomer_Simpson: I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems.\\nBarney_Gumble: Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, isn\\'t that nice. Now, there is a politician who cares.\\nBarney_Gumble: If I ever vote, it\\'ll be for him. (BELCH)\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey Homer, how\\'s your neighbor\\'s store doing?\\nHomer_Simpson: Lousy. He just sits there all day. He\\'d have a great job if he didn\\'t own the place. (CHUCKLES)\\nMoe_Szyslak: (STRUGGLING WITH CORKSCREW) Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell?\\nHomer_Simpson: Uh, well actually, Moe...\\nHOMER_(CONT\\'D: I dunno.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Looks like this is the end.\\nBarney_Gumble: That\\'s all right. I couldn\\'t have led a richer life.\\nBarney_Gumble: So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!\\nLisa_Simpson: I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'m profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick.\\nBarney_Gumble: Oh, that\\'s sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too. (BELCH)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk.\\nLisa_Simpson: Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s the matter, Homer? The depressin\\' effects of alcohol usually don\\'t kick in \\'til closing time.\\nLisa_Simpson: He\\'s just a little nervous. (PROUDLY) He has to give a speech tomorrow on \"How To Keep Cool In A Crisis.\"\\nHomer_Simpson: (SOBS) What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.\\nHomer_Simpson: Did it work?\\nBarney_Gumble: I\\'m a free man, ain\\'t I?\\nBarney_Gumble: Whoa!\\nBarney_Gumble: Huh? A pretzel? Wow, looks like I pulled a Homer!\\n\\n\\nPatrons: (MUMBLING, NOT IN UNISON) Happy thoughts... happy thoughts... we love that boy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Moe\\'s Tavern. Hold on, I\\'ll check. ... (LOUD) Hey everybody! I\\'m a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt.\\nBarney_Gumble: That\\'s a new one (LAUGHING).\\nMoe_Szyslak: Now wait a minute...\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Hurry, Moe, hurry! I\\'ve only got five minutes till the music store closes.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Why don\\'t you go there first?\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Sorry, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: You know, if you tip the glass, there won\\'t be so much foam on top.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Sorry, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: (LOOKING AT WATCH) Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.\\nLittle_Man: (CONCERNED) What\\'s the matter, buddy?\\nHomer_Simpson: The moron next door closed early!\\nLittle_Man: (STIFFENING) I happen to be that moron.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, me and my trenchant mouth.\\nHomer_Simpson: Please, you\\'ve got to open that store.\\nLittle_Man: Let me think about it... Eh... No.\\nHomer_Simpson: Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you\\'re disappointing. (GOES THROUGH HIS WALLET) Well I don\\'t have one.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (TO LITTLE MAN) Come on, Jer. Open up. Be a pal. Remember when I pulled you and your wife out of that burning car?\\nLittle_Man: (GRUDGINGLY) Okay. Okay. But now we\\'re even. (TO HOMER) So what does your daughter need?\\nHomer_Simpson: (SMOOTHLY) I\\'ll have you know, I wrote it down.\\nHomer_Simpson: Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!\\nHomer_Simpson: Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!\\nLittle_Man: Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play?\\nHomer_Simpson: (SUNK) I dunno.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (TO PATRONS) Figure of speech.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hiya, Homer. (SIGHS)\\nHomer_Simpson: What\\'s the matter, Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn\\'t for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Yeah, things are tough all over.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.\\nHomer_Simpson: Could I get a beer?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, yeah, sure.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh sorry, I forgot we\\'re out of beer.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the \"Love Tester\".\\nMoe_Szyslak: You\\'re too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at Bartender\\'s School.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (UNFAMILIAR) Gin and... tonic? Do they mix?\\nHomer_Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Sorry, Harv.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?\\nHomer_Simpson: A \"Flaming Homer\".\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, why don\\'t you make us up a couple of \"Flaming Homers\"?\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, let me check the lost and found.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh. Here we are.\\nMoe_Szyslak: It\\'s not without its charm.\\nHomer_Simpson: Try lighting it on fire.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SMILING) Whoa! Homer, it\\'s like there\\'s a party in my mouth and everyone\\'s invited.\\nLarry: Hey, your Love Tester\\'s busted. I want my nickel back. (COUGHS)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, buddy. Have one on the house.\\nLarry: Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, it\\'s called a \"Flaming...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Moe! It\\'s called a \"Flaming Moe\"! That\\'s right, a \"Flaming Moe\". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That\\'s why it\\'s called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin\\' at, Homer? It\\'s a Flaming Moe I\\'m Moe.\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey, what\\'s this?\\nMoe_Szyslak: A sneeze guard.\\nBarney_Gumble: Wow, it really works.\\nHARV: (CHUCKLING) I\\'ll be back.\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe, I haven\\'t seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Who can say? It\\'s probably a combination of things.\\nPatron_#1: (TO MOE) Another pitcher of those amazing \"Flaming Moe\\'s\".\\nPatron_#2: Boy, I hate this joint, but I love that drink.\\nCollette: Barkeep, I couldn\\'t help noticing your sign.\\nMoe_Szyslak: The one that says, \"Bartenders Do It \\'Til You Barf\"?\\nCollette: No, above that store-bought drollery.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh great! Why don\\'t we fill out an application? (READING) I\\'ll need your name, measurements and turn ons..\\nCollette: You really expect me to tell you my measurements?\\nMoe_Szyslak: You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun.\\nCollette: (DISGUSTED) what do you offer in the way of salary?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Minimum wage and tips. (MEANINGFULLY) Of course there are fringe benefits.\\nCollette: Such as?\\nMoe_Szyslak: An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.\\nCollette: I prefer to take my vacations someplace hot.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I like your moxie, kid. You\\'re hired.\\nCollette: You shan\\'t regret this.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Methinks I shan\\'t.\\nHARV: (TO MOE) Pardon me, are you the genius behind the \"Flaming Moe\"?\\nHomer_Simpson: Why yes I --\\nMoe_Szyslak: (CUTTING HIM OFF) I\\'m your man.\\nHARV: Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for \"Tipsy McStagger\\'s Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium\".\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh yeah? Hey, what\\'s Mr. McStagger really like?\\nHARV: Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He\\'s just a composite of other successful logos.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick.\\nHARV: (QUICKLY) Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I\\'ve got a proposition for you.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Keep talkin\\'.\\nHARV: We feel your \"Flaming Moe\" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No dice. The \"Flaming Moe\" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?\\nBarney_Gumble: Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million dollar idea like that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (TO HARV) I\\'m sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me.\\nDelivery_Man: (TO MOE) Thirty cases of cough syrup. Sign here.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (COVERING NERVOUS LAUGHING) I got hooked on this stuff in the service.\\nHomer_Simpson: (QUIETLY) Hi, Moe. Where\\'s that waitress of yours?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here.\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret.\\nHomer_Simpson: I guess so.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Compliments of the house. (WARMLY) One \"Flaming Homer\".\\nHomer_Simpson: Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You\\'re the greatest friend a guy could ever have.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?\\nMoe_Szyslak: I doubt it.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SHOCKED) Are you sure? Cuz once I open the bottle there\\'s no refund.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff?\\nHomer_Simpson: (SMOOTHLY) No, I\\'d like a bottle of Henry K. Duff\\'s Private Reserve.\\nHomer_Simpson: For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that\\'s my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy.\\nHomer_Simpson: Have a Duff, boys!\\nHans: (GERMAN ACCENT, FRIENDLY) Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us. Do I have that right? I am saying that only a swine would drink this beer.\\nFritz: (GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, but thank you anyway.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, you guys aren\\'t from around here, are you?\\nHans: Ech, nein. We are from Germany. He is from the East. I am from the West.\\nFritz: I had a big company and he had a big company. Now we have a very big company.\\nHans: We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it?\\nHomer_Simpson: (VERY CONFIDENT) Well, I happen to know that he won\\'t sell it for less than 100 million dollars.\\nFritz: A hundred million?\\nHans: Oh, don\\'t worry! We\\'ll still have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Moe\\'s Tavern. Moe speaking.\\nBart_Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Uh yes, I\\'m looking for a Mrs. O\\'Problem.

Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated.\\nHomer_Simpson: That\\'s right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.\\nHomer_Simpson: (POINTED) Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you\\'re feeling blue?\\nC._Montgomery_Burns: Yes.\\nHomer_Simpson: Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?\\nC._Montgomery_Burns: (SHAKEN) Why, no.\\nHomer_Simpson: And does it ever say, \"I love you?\"\\nC._Montgomery_Burns: (SHAKEN) No, it doesn\\'t.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SING-SONG) Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You\\'re old and you\\'re ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!\\nHomer_Simpson: Nobody loves you...\\nC._Montgomery_Burns: Good heavens, Smithers!

I want to play.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No. We\\'re phasing out the games. People drink less when they\\'re havin\\' fun.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe, I need your advice.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah.\\nHomer_Simpson: See, I got this friend named...(PAUSE) Joey Joe Joe Junior... (PAUSE) Schabadoo.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'s the worst name I ever heard.\\nBarney_Gumble: (CALLING AFTER HIM) Hey, Joey Joe Joe!\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, what the hell, it\\'s me. I\\'m attracted to another woman. What am I going to do?\\nBarney_Gumble: (RECITING) \"Your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. Talk to the woman, and you\\'ll realize you have nothing in common.\"\\nHomer_Simpson: Barney. That is so insightful. How did you come up with that?\\nBarney_Gumble: It was on one of these bar napkins.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Okay, we\\'ve got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I\\'ll be \"Cueball.\" Skinner can be \"Eightball\", Barney will be \"Twelveball,\" and Moe, you can be \"Cueball.\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: You\\'re an idiot.\\n\\n\\nDr._Babcock: Excuse me?\\nHomer_Simpson: Hello, is this President Clinton?

It was... him.\\nSTILLWATER: Sir, how would you like to get higher than you\\'ve ever been in your life?\\nBarney_Gumble: Be an astronaut? Sure.\\nSTILLWATER: Well, welcome aboard.

Check with the FBI, I have a file. I HAVE A FIIIIILE.\\nSTILLWATER: (SHRUGGING) Eh, better take both of them.\\nSTILLWATER: I don\\'t really think that was necessary. They wanted to be astronauts.\\nDr._Babcock: I know.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey everyone!\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'d like to introduce Ned Flanders, my best friend.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (TO HOMER) Hey, I don\\'t want no people in here with their evils of alcohol rap.\\nNed_Flanders: Wait a second.

Homer.\\nMarge_Simpson: (FLUSTERED) Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball\\'s name. I\\'m Marge.\\nJacques: Your fingers are so slender, so feminine. They are far too tapered for the ball you are using. You need something lighter, more delicate. Here, use my ball.\\nMarge_Simpson: No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... (LOOKS AT THE NAME ON HIS BALL)... Brunswick.\\nJacques: Call me Jacques.\\nMarge_Simpson: Jacques.\\nJacques: Marge.\\nMarge_Simpson: Hmmm.\\nJacques: May I ask you a bold question?\\nMarge_Simpson: Sure.\\nJacques: You\\'ve never bowled before?\\nMarge_Simpson: Never.\\nJacques: No?\\nMarge_Simpson: No.\\nJacques: Then I will teach you.\\nMarge_Simpson: Oh, I don\\'t want to trouble you.\\nJacques: Not at all.

Ooh, ooh, taking advantage of my alcohol soaked clothes. (LAUGHS) It\\'s funny and it makes you think.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SERIOUS) Oh I need some coffee before I black out. Homer, pass me the sugar.\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO HIMSELF) This is gonna to be great.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ooh!\\nBarney_Gumble: Geez!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, there\\'s sugar all over the bar now.\\nLenny_Leonard: That\\'s not funny, Homer.\\nBarney_Gumble: Yeah, we were just messin\\' around. And you had to go too far.\\nMoe_Szyslak: How many people want Homer banned from this place for life?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah!\\nHomer_Simpson: (PLEADING) Ah, come on, everybody. This bar is like a tavern to me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Sorry, Homer. You should have thought of that before you gave me the old sugar-me-do. I\\'m taking your caricature down from Mt. Lushmore.\\nMoe_Szyslak: And I\\'m pulling your favorite song out of the juke box.\\nHomer_Simpson: (GASP) \"It\\'s Raining Men?\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, not no more it ain\\'t.\\nWaylon_Smithers: Oww. (READING LABEL, SUDDENLY INTRIGUED) Ohh...\\nHomer_Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Jokes on them. I\\'m still alive.\\nMan: (VERY POLITE) Greetings, good man. Might I trouble you for a drink?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, get outta here, Homer.\\nMan: (TOO INNOCENT) \"Homer?\" Who is Homer? My name is Guy Incognito.\\nHomer_Simpson: (GASPS) Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. (GASPS WITH EQUAL ASTONISHMENT) That dog has a puffy tail!\\nHomer_Simpson: Here, Puff! Here Puff! (GIGGLES)\\nHomer_Simpson: The last bar in Springfield. If they don\\'t let me in here, I\\'m gonna have to quit drinking.\\nHomer_Simpson: Shut up, liver.\\nHomer_Simpson: (PUZZLED) Ooh, my liver hurts.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Sure, Homer, I can loan you all the money you need. However (HE LEANS IN CONFIDENTIALLY) since you have no collateral, I\\'m gonna have to break your legs in advance.\\nHomer_Simpson: (LOOKING AT HIS LEGS) Gosh, Moe, I use these all the time. Couldn\\'t you just bash my head in?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, hey! Are you a loan shark? Do you understand how finance works? (HE PULLS OUT A HUGE SLEDGE-HAMMER) Now let\\'s do this thing.\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: There\\'s a line in \"Othello\" about a drinker -- \"now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast.\" That pretty well covers it.\\nWoman: It\\'s brilliant. Savagely honest, tender -- he has the soul of a poet.\\nBarney_Gumble: (TURNING TO HER) You\\'re very kind.\\nWoman: (DISGUSTED) Excuse me did something crawl down your throat and die?\\nBarney_Gumble: It didn\\'t die.\\nBarney_Gumble: My name is Barney and I\\'m an alcoholic.\\nLisa_Simpson: Mr. Gumbel, this is a Girl Scout meeting.\\nBarney_Gumble: Is it? Or is it that you girls can\\'t admit you have a problem?\\n\\n\\nKent_Brockman: And tonight the following celebrities have been arrested:\\nKent_Brockman: ...while Heather Locklear Fortensky remains at large. Remember, if you see any celebrities, consider them dangerous.\\nHUGH: You know, I rather like this pub.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (POURING) Oh, an English boy, eh? You know we saved your ass in World War Two.\\nHUGH: Yeah, well, we saved your ass in World War Three.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'s true.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hugh, there\\'s something I want you to have. My Dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day I married Marge, and they brought us good luck. I couldn\\'t imagine a happier marriage. We don\\'t have many traditions in our family, but it\\'d mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.\\nHUGH: (MOVED) Well I\\'d be honored...\\nHUGH: (FINISHING WITH LESS ENTHUSIASM) ...to wear... those... things.\\nBart_Simpson: Ow! Hey watch those virtual darts. I\\'m trying to play virtual pool!\\nOther_Player: Ow!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, hey, no fightin\\' in my bar.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey! If you guys are getting loaded off them fumes, I\\'m gonna have to charge ya.\\nBarney_Gumble: These fumes aren\\'t as fun as beer. Sure, I\\'m all dizzy and nauseous, but where\\'s the inflated sense of self-esteem?\\nMale_Inspector: (SHOCKED) Man alive! There are men alive in here!\\nFemale_Inspector: I\\'m detecting over twenty different toxins in the air.\\nMale_Inspector: All right, everybody out! As long as Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Damn Burns... (STEELY-EYED RAGE) Lemme just get one thing.\\nBarney_Gumble: Me too.\\nBarney_Gumble: Ahhhh, now there\\'s the inflated sense of self-esteem.\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: Wow! You mean you were one of the original Little Rascals?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah.\\nHomer_Simpson: Which one were you? The ugly one?\\nHomer_Simpson: Were you the ugly one?\\nMoe_Szyslak: No. I was the tough kid. Smelly. My shtick was looking into an exhaust pipe and gettin\\' a faceful of soot. Heh, nobody could do that better than me. Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time, but you know, we had good writers. William Faulkner could write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think.\\nBarney_Gumble: If you were such a big shot, why aren\\'t you still making movies?\\nBarney_Gumble: Moe?... Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh no! My favorite aggie!\\nMoe_Szyslak: You stole my bit! You... That\\'s my bit ya... Ya... ooh, ooh, you stole my bit!\\nDirector: Cut!\\nStagehand: Oh my God! He\\'s killed the original Alfalfa!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah. Luckily, Alfalfa was an orphan owned by the studio.\\nAll: (MURMUR UNDERSTANDING ASSENT) Oh, I see / Yeah / That makes sense.\\nKent_Brockman: With wealthy Hollywood people on the way, local merchants can be forgiven for raising their prices a little.\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: (FLAILING) Agh! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me!\\nDr._Julius_Hibbert: (LOOKING AROUND) Oh, I\\'m sorry. I thought this was a family restaurant.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (LYING) Oh, it is. It is. Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table.\\nLittle_Hibbert_Girl: Daddy, this place smells like tinkle.\\nDr._Julius_Hibbert: Mmm-hmm, I think we\\'ll just go to The Texas Cheesecake Depository.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Everybody is goin\\' to family restaurants these days. Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.\\nCarl_Carlson: Ya ain\\'t thinking of gettin\\' rid of the dank, are ya, Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, maybe I am.\\nCarl_Carlson: Aw, but Moe, the dank. The dank!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (LOST IN THOUGHT) Yeah. Family restaurants. That\\'s where the big bucks are. I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn\\'t be ashamed to bring your family, huh?\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'m not ashamed.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, put a coaster under that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So come on. I need a name that says friendly, all-American cooking.\\nHomer_Simpson: How about Chairman Moe\\'s Magic Wok?\\nBarney-Shaped_Form: I like it!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Nah. I want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time.\\nHomer_Simpson: I got it! Madman Moe\\'s Pressure Cooker!\\nBarney-Shaped_Form: I like it!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SNAPS FINGERS, INSPIRED) Hey, how about Uncle Moe\\'s Family Feedbag?\\nBarney-Shaped_Form: I hate it.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh boy. The deep fryer\\'s here.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I got it used from the Navy. You can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.\\nHomer_Simpson: Forty seconds? (WHINING) But I want it now.\\nMoe_Szyslak: G\\'on, take it all. Get it all out of here.\\nBarney_Gumble: You know, Moe, you might want to keep the fire extinguishers.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Nah. Too many bad memories.\\nBarney_Gumble: Well, look at the bright side, Moe. You still got us.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (CHEERING UP) Yeah. Yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better.\\nHomer_Simpson: Why? That was the problem in the first place. You were going broke because we were your only customers. Wasn\\'t that the problem in the first place? That you were going broke... Moe?\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you\\'re thinking about all the money you blew, aren\\'tcha?\\nHomer_Simpson: What was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... Moe? Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: What?\\nHomer_Simpson: Let me get a pad....\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Gee, business stinks tonight. Where\\'s Barney, Lenny, and Carl?\\nHomer_Simpson: Ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they\\'ve got their (ROLLING EYES) mistresses.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SOTTO, LOOKING AT HOMER) Eh, might as well close the dump.\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: I\\'m gonna drink you under the table.\\nQuimby_#2: No, I am going to drink you under the...\\nQuimbys: (DISAPPOINTED) Awwww.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SIGHS) Well, you\\'re closing. It\\'s getting late. My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. (DESPERATE) There\\'s gotta be some other place we can go. Think, Moe. Think.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (RINGING BELL) Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Aw, the little cutie wants to do something cute... (TO BARFLIES) Shut up, ya bums, shut up! Go ahead, angel.\\nLisa_Simpson: Jebediah Springfield was nothing more than an evil, blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SLOW & HORRIFIED) Good God. (TURNS TO HOMER) Homer, y\\'know I support most any prejudice you can name, but your hero-phobia sickens me. You and your daughter ain\\'t welcome here no more. Barney, show \\'em the exit.\\nBarney_Gumble: There\\'s an exit?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (UNDER HIS BREATH) \"Evil blood-thirsty pirate\"... Hello, Town Jubilation Committee? I got something that\\'s going to make you a lot less jubilant.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Moe\\'s Tavern.\\nC._Montgomery_Burns: I\\'m looking for a Mr. Smithers. First name, Waylon.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, so you\\'re looking for a Mr. Smithers, eh? First name, Waylon, is it? (SUDDENLY VICIOUS) Listen to me, you... when I catch you, I\\'m going to pull out your eyes and shove \\'em up your pants so you can watch me kick the crap out of you. Okay? Then I\\'m going to use your tongue to paint my boat.\\nWaylon_Smithers: Uh, hello. You had a \"help wanted\" sign in the window?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, yeah, I need someone to help me with the midnight beer delivery. Your job is to distract Barney until it\\'s safely off the truck.\\nWaylon_Smithers: I\\'ll just wait out back until then.\\nBarney_Gumble: I look forward to working with you!\\nHomer_Simpson: Mr. Smithers, wait!\\nHomer_Simpson: You can\\'t let yourself end up in a place like this. You\\'ve got two choices: You can give up on yourself and take the Barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. Or you can admit to yourself there\\'s only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back.\\nWaylon_Smithers: You\\'re right! But I\\'m going to need your help.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh,... my... God!...\\nTruck_Driver: Beer delivery. Just sign here-- (HORRIFIED) Oh, no, it\\'s you!!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (TIPSY) Aw, hell.

(LAUGHS) Whoa! Oh, I\\'m sorry, Mr. S., but you know, I gotta check everybody.\\nBart_Simpson: (JOVIAL) Are you kidding? I take it as a compliment! (CHUCKLE) Three beers, please!\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey, join the party! (SICKLY, PATHETIC BURP)\\nMoe_Szyslak: (ON PHONE) Ura Snotball?\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Say, ah, Barn. Remember when I said I\\'d have to send away to NASA to calculate your bar tab?\\nBarney_Gumble: (CHUCKLES) Oh yeah, we all had a good laugh, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (DEAD SERIOUS) The results came back today.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (READING) You owe me... 70 billion dollars.

(BEAT) Your tab\\'s 14 billion dollars.\\nBarney_Gumble: Well, alls I got is two thousand bucks.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (CONSIDERING) Well, that\\'s halfway there.\\nSnake_Jailbird: (TO MOE) Huh. Freeze, dude. Move a muscle and I\\'ll blow this wino\\'s head off.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (MUFFLED) I\\'m behind three inches of bullet-proof glass. Do your worst.\\nSnake_Jailbird: (REASONABLE) All right.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No! Stay outta there! Stay outta there! Aw, Good God, no!!\\nSnake_Jailbird: Whoa, goodbye student loan payments! Ha-ha!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Come back here, you stinkin\\' -- (LOOKS AROUND, A BIT CONCERNED) Hey, I wonder how much air is in here.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. They want all the benefits of livin\\' in Springfield, but they ain\\'t even bothered to learn themselves the language.\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah. Those are exactly my sentimonies.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, you said it, Barn.\\n\\n\\nJimbo\\'s_Dad: That\\'s for tellin\\' me how to raise my lousy kid!\\nDolph\\'s_Dad: This is for the crummy life I\\'ve had to live! (THROWS ANOTHER PUNCH)\\nHomer_Simpson: (STILL REASONABLE) The thing is -- oof! -- Bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!\\nKearney\\'s_Dad: Hey, somethin\\'s wrong with this guy! He\\'s not fallin\\' down!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Fun\\'s over, fellas. If you\\'re gonna beat up my friend in my bar, there\\'s a two-drink minimum.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Jeez, Homer, I never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- I mean, you took a three-man poundin\\' and didn\\'t ever fall down.\\nHomer_Simpson: (GLUM) Big deal. I didn\\'t even get my kid\\'s belt back. The only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EXCITED) There ya go! That\\'s the spirit! Homer, I seen prizefighters couldn\\'t take a punch half as good as you! (GETTING A BIG IDEA) Y\\'know, boxing might be right up your alley!\\nHomer_Simpson: (PERKING UP) Really?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Aw, please, it\\'s the good life, Homer. Some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!\\nHomer_Simpson: (GASP OF AWE) Dressing?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Their choice.\\nHomer_Simpson: You really think I could do it?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, I dunno, are you man enough to test every one of your limits?\\nHomer_Simpson: Yes!\\nMoe_Szyslak: And are you man enough to throw a punch, should the opportunity arise?\\nHomer_Simpson: Yes!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (\"THE CLINCHER\") And are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?\\nHomer_Simpson: YES!!\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'ll take it!!\\nHomer_Simpson: Woo hoo!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Now, Homer, if I\\'m gonna manage your boxing career, I wantcha to have complete faith in me. C\\'mere, lemme show ya somethin\\'...\\nHomer_Simpson: Wow! I\\'ve never been in here before!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, well, when I realized we hadn\\'t had no ladies in here since 1979, I turned it into an office.\\nHomer_Simpson: You used to be a boxer just like me?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yep. They called me \"Kid Gorgeous.\" Later on, it was \"Kid Presentable.\" Then \"Kid Gruesome.\" And finally, \"Kid Moe.\"\\nHomer_Simpson: (NOTICING SOMETHING) Hey, what\\'s this?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Aw, that -- that\\'s my old spit bucket. Yeah, I been meanin\\' to empty that out.\\nHomer_Simpson: (GASP) You know Lucius Sweet? He\\'s one of the biggest names in boxing! He\\'s exactly as rich and as famous as Don King, and he looks just like him, too.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, he was my manager. Back when I was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. But somehow I just never made it to the big time.\\nHomer_Simpson: Why not?\\nMoe_Szyslak: \\'Cause I got knocked out forty times in a row. That, plus politics. You know, it\\'s all politics...\\nHomer_Simpson: (IN BITTER AGREEMENT) Lousy Democrats.\\nBarney_Gumble: Man, you\\'d never get me into a ring. Boxing causes brain damage!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay. You\\'re fighting a guy named Boxcar Bob.\\nHomer_Simpson: Brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, no. Not yet. He still lives at the train yard. But he\\'s a hungry young fighter. In fact, he\\'s actually fighting for a sandwich.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer, I want you to have my lucky mitts. I hope you do better with \\'em than I did.\\nHomer_Simpson: (TOUCHED) Gee, thanks, Moe... What\\'s this?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Aw, that\\'s the barbed wire. Heh. We, uh, we called that \"The Stinger.\" They... they don\\'t let you use that no more.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Now, no matter how much he hits you, you don\\'t do nothin\\', okay? You don\\'t wanna get drawn into a boxing match here.\\nBart_Simpson: Way to go, Dad! Take those punches!\\nLenny_Leonard: Man, that tramp\\'s got the energy of a hobo!\\nCarl_Carlson: Yeah, he never stops punching... \\'cept to check on his bindle.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, Homer, he\\'s tired! He\\'s tired! Now\\'s your chance! Nudge him! Nudge him!\\nLUCIUS: Hello, Moe. Delightful to see you again.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (AWED) Lucius! Hey, what\\'s a glitterati like you doin\\' in my dump? I--I thought you were managing the Champ.\\nLUCIUS: Yes, managing Drederick has been my highest priority, even though he is temporarily incarcerated for pushing his mother down the stairs. But with his impending release, I\\'ve been strategizing for his glorious return to the shores of fistiana.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, what?\\nLUCIUS: (BEAT) His comeback fight. You know, boxing.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, oh, man. Yeah, well, who\\'s donatin\\' his body for that one? Huh?\\nLUCIUS: Well, word is you manage a stalwart young pugilist who cannot be knocked down.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INCREDULOUS) Homer? You want Homer to fight Tatum?\\nLUCIUS: Well, the fans are weary of fights that are over before they have an opportunity to even get drunk. I just need a body who can sustain verticality for three rounds.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah. But Homer\\'s no boxer, he-- he\\'s just a freak. Tatum\\'ll fustigate him!\\nLUCIUS: Well, fustigation aside, Moe, you\\'ve got a choice: you can either sit here in the ladies room with your faded memories, or you can take your last shot at the big time. (DRAMATIC) And I can make it happen.\\nLUCIUS: Three rounds, that\\'s all I ask.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I gotta be honest with ya, Homer. I didn\\'t bring you up here to show you my new tar-paper.\\nHomer_Simpson: (NAIVELY) You... didn\\'t?\\nMoe_Szyslak: No. Homer, how would you like to be Heavyweight Champion of the World?\\nHomer_Simpson: Uh, sure.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Great. All you gotta do is fight Drederick Tatum. It\\'s this Saturday. Here\\'s your parking pass.\\nHomer_Simpson: (IMPRESSED) Ooh, \"General!\" (BEAT) Who\\'s Drederick Tatum, anyway? Is he another hobo?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EVASIVE) Uh, you know what? I\\'m gonna have to check on that...\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, I trust you, Moe. If you say I can beat this guy, then he doesn\\'t stand a chance.\\n\\n\\nLarry: Everybody go nuts, I\\'m buyin\\'! (TO MOE) Hey, Handsome, send the bill to my dad.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink to Burns turned up in a landfill.\\nBarney_Gumble: Yeah. (REMEMBERING FONDLY) But it was worth it!\\nLarry: What\\'s everybody in this burg have against my Dad? He\\'s a pussycat. I tell ya, he\\'s a doll-baby. (TO HOMER) Come on over, I\\'ll show ya!\\n\\n\\nKirk_Van_Houten: Homer! I want you to meet my new special lady. Say hello to Starla.\\nStarla: Can I have the keys to the car, lover? I feel like changing wigs.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: Okay.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: Starla\\'s a temp at K-ZUG (\\'KAY-ZUGG\\') Radio 530. She\\'s going to help me launch my singing career.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: My car!\\nKirk_Van_Houten: Oh! My demo tape!\\nHomer_Simpson: (READING) \"Can I Borrow A Feeling?\" (LAUGHS) \"Can I Borrow A Feeling?\" (STILL LAUGHING) There\\'s your picture on the front.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: Go ahead, Homer. Laugh at me.\\nHomer_Simpson: I already did.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: You know why all this happened, don\\'t you? \\'Cause I took my marriage for granted. Y\\'know, in twelve years, I never once helped out with the housework.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh yeah. You gotta do that.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: I could\\'ve at least stayed in shape for her.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, and for yourself.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: I could\\'ve taken just a little time to... to make her feel special.\\nHomer_Simpson: It can\\'t just be sex. It can\\'t.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: God, I was so self-centered. No wonder I didn\\'t see it coming. (SHAKING HEAD) That\\'s how it is, though: one day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day you\\'re thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink.\\nHomer_Simpson: (UNDERSTANDING) Ooh, that\\'s tough, pal. But it\\'s never going to happen to me.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: Oh, how do you know? What makes you guys so special?\\nHomer_Simpson: \\'Cause Marge and I have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Carl?\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer.\\nBarney_Gumble: Okay, but I\\'m not your soul mate. I\\'m really more of a chum.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well what about you, Lenny?\\nLenny_Leonard: (HELPFUL) I\\'m a crony.\\nCarl_Carlson: I\\'d say acquaintance.\\nSam: Call me sympathizer.\\nBumblebee_Man: Compadre.\\nKearney_Zzyzwicz: Associate.\\nDr._Julius_Hibbert: Contemporary.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m a well-wisher, in that I don\\'t wish you any specific harm.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Another Duff, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: Nah, it\\'s Friday night Moe. I wanna try something special.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, sure, sure.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, here you go. Düff. (DOOF) From Sweden. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)\\nHomer_Simpson: Skoal! (SIPS) Wait a minute -- this is Duff!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (NASTY LAUGH) Ah, ha ha, you got me, didn\\'t ya? (HANDING HOMER A BEER) All right, here you go -- \"Red Tick Beer.\"\\nHomer_Simpson: Hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something I can\\'t quite put my finger on.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, it\\'s one a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Just a second, Homer, you gotta take a breathalyzer test before I let you drive home.\\nHomer_Simpson: Eh, I guess I\\'ll walk home.\\nFox_Mulder: All right, Homer. We want you to recreate your every move the night you saw this alien.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, the evening began at the Gentleman\\'s Club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.\\nDana_Scully: Mr. Simpson, it\\'s a felony to lie to the FBI.\\nHomer_Simpson: (ASHAMED) We were sitting in Barney\\'s car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO SCULLY) You are one fine-lookin\\' woman, lady. If I wasn\\'t married, I\\'d go out with you like that.\\nHomer_Simpson: (DRUNK, REMORSEFUL) I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don\\'t tell Marge. God, I love her. I-- (LOOKING DOWN) Hey, a penny!\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, uh, who are you guys anyhow?\\nFox_Mulder: Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EDGY) FBI, huh? Uh, S\\'cuse me.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (DIMLY) Oh yeah.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Here you go, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: Thanks, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (GENEROUSLY) Aw, Homer. You know your money\\'s no good here.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, wait a minute -- this is real money!\\nHomer_Simpson: (PROUDLY) Yeah, my wife is raking it in.\\nFat_Tony: (CLEARS THROAT) Greetings, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: (HAPPY TO SEE HIM) Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?\\nFat_Tony: (LOOKING AROUND NERVOUSLY) Uh, uh, yes. I am. Thank you for asking. Now Homer, as you no doubt recall, you were done a favor by our, uh... how shall I say, Mafia crime syndicate.\\nFat_Tony: Now, the time has come for you to do us a favor.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SHOCKED AND HURT) You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... (INDIGNANT) I will say good day to you, sir.\\nFat_Tony: (ASHAMED) Okay, I will go.\\nFat_Tony: (REALIZING) Hey, wait a minute.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (HANGING UP) Well, Homer\\'s out. We gotta find a new General Ambrose Burnside.\\nBarney_Gumble: And I\\'m not too crazy about our Stonewall Jackson.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: The South shall \"come again!\"\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: ...and the entire steel mill was gay!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (NOT SURPRISED) Where ya been, Homer? Entire steel industry\\'s gay.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, aerospace, too. And the railroads. And ya know what else? (NODS KNOWINGLY) Broadway!\\nBarney_Gumble: I always hoped Bart\\'d grow up to be just like us. What happened?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, it ain\\'t no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin\\' effect on kids today. And their MTV\\'s and their diet sodas ain\\'t gonna set \\'em straight neither. You gotta do it yourself, Homer. And you gotta do it fast.\\nHomer_Simpson: But what would turn Bart into a man fast? You have to think for me!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, lessee now... uh, time was, you\\'d send a boy off to war. Shootin\\' a man\\'d fix him right up. (MAD) But there\\'s not even any wars no more thank you very much Warren Christopher!\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey, better yet, Bart could shoot a deer. That\\'s like shooting a beautiful man!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, he\\'s right, Homer. After the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won\\'t turn him back. Then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!\\nHomer_Simpson: (CONSIDERS IT) Hunting, eh?\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (WHINY MOAN) It\\'s been St. Patrick\\'s Day for hours and I\\'m still not drunk yet. (LOOKS AT WATCH) Oh, it\\'s never gonna be nine o\\'clock.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, Moe, thank God you\\'re here! We\\'d like to come in and drink, please!\\nLenny_Leonard: We kicked down the back door, but then there was a metal door.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, all right, listen up! This is the busiest drinkin\\' day of the year. Where are the designated drivers?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Beat it! I got no room for cheapskates.\\nHomer_Simpson: Look at me! I\\'m the Prime Minister of Ireland!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, Homer, ain\\'t that your kid on TV?\\nBart_Simpson: (MENACING) What are yew lookin\\' at?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Who wants a bathtub mint julep?\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (WRITING) \"Barney Gumbel\".\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, I can\\'t believe it. I\\'ve got an enemy. Me! The most beloved man in Springfield.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, it\\'s a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people don\\'t care for me, neither.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SHAKING HEAD) No, I won\\'t accept that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No, it\\'s true. I\\'ve got their names written down right here, in what I call my, uh, \"enemies list\".\\nBarney_Gumble: (READING) Jane Fonda, Daniel Schorr, Jack Anderson... Hey, this is Richard Nixon\\'s enemies list! You just crossed out his name and put yours.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, gimme that. Gimme it back!\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOROSE) Oh, what\\'ll I do, Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, why don\\'t you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy into a friend. Then when he\\'s not expecting it, bam! The old fork in the eye.\\nHomer_Simpson: Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?\\nMoe_Szyslak: There\\'s always a first time.\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: (TO CHAUFFEUR) Thanks for the lift!\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: Well, ah, I better go. I\\'ve got a date with that lady in front of the drug store who\\'s always yelling things.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (HURT, TO SELF) She told me she was washin\\' her hair tonight. (SIGHS) I\\'m so desperately lonely.\\nGrampa_Simpson: Ah, quit your belly-aching, ya big loser!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (LOOKING AROUND) Wh... who said that?\\nGrampa_Simpson: I did. It\\'s me, Abe Simpson.\\nMoe_Szyslak: But you\\'re dea-d-d-dead. (THREE STOOGES SCARED SOUND)\\nGrampa_Simpson: (UPBEAT) I was! But I\\'ve come back... as your love testing machine!\\nGrampa_Simpson: I\\'m the love-matic Grampa!\\nSingers: (PEPPY) WHILE SHOPPING FOR SOME CANS / AN OLD MAN PASSED AWAY / HE FLOATED UP TOWARD HEAVEN / BUT GOT LOST ALONG THE WAY...\\nSingers: NOW HE\\'S THE LOVE-MATIC GRAMPA! / THE WISE SOCRATIC GRAMPA! / (SWELLING, MUSHY) AND HE\\'LL FILL OUR HEARTS WITH LOVE!\\nGrampa_Simpson: Don\\'t be afraid, Moe. I\\'m here to help you with your romantic problems.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, I don\\'t need no advice from no pinball machine. I\\'ll have you know I wrote the book on love.\\nGrampa_Simpson: Yeah -- \"All Quiet On The Western Front!\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ahh, kiss my dishrag!\\nGrampa_Simpson: See? That\\'s your problem. You\\'re a crab. Ladies like sweet talkers.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (DEFENSIVE) Hey, I\\'m sweet. I\\'m sweeter than Jewish wine.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Barney, where\\'s my car?!!\\n\\n\\nGrampa_Simpson: Then prove it. I want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.\\nHomer_Simpson: (CATCH-PHRASE) Ah, grrrreetings!\\nGrampa_Simpson: Son, it\\'s me! I floated up toward heaven, but got lost along the way!\\nHomer_Simpson: (GASP; AWED) Dad? Is that really you?\\nGrampa_Simpson: Darn tootin\\', ya lousy fink! You buried me naked and sold my suit to buy a ping-pong table! What kind of a son--\\nHomer_Simpson: (DISMISSIVE SNORT) Call me when you get a karaoke machine.\\nGrampa_Simpson: That\\'s the second time he pulled the plug on me.\\nBetty: I was just in a car accident. Can I use your phone?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, usin\\' the phone\\'s a four-drink minimum.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (ASIDE TO GRAMPA) What\\'s the matter? I\\'m making as nice as I can.\\nGrampa_Simpson: (TRYING TO SOUND MECHANICAL) Test- lady. Test-lady.\\nMoe_Szyslak: G\\'ahead. Give it a try.\\nMoe_Szyslak: It goes by how clammy your hands are.\\nBetty: Well, I suppose I could use a laugh after that accident.\\nGrampa_Simpson: (TRYING TO SOUND MECHANICAL) Lovelorn. You-need-man. Moe-near-now. Go-near- Moe.\\nBetty: (CONFUSED) What?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EXPLAINING) \"Go near Moe.\" I\\'d say that\\'s a pretty strong endorsement. So, how about you and me go out sometime? You know, out back.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I mean, uh, out to dinner at a fancy French restaurant?\\nBetty: (SEXY) Sounds great. And if this Love Tester\\'s as accurate as it looks, maybe we\\'ll be having breakfast, too.\\nMoe_Szyslak: You did it, Grampa! You really are a love expert.\\nGrampa_Simpson: Dang right! Fact is, I invented kissing. It was during World War One, and they were looking for a new way to spread germs...\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Wha-- Uh-oh. Here comes the evening rush. Clear out, fellas.\\nBarflies: What a day. / Let\\'s get started. / Some serious drinkin\\'. / (ETC.)\\nHomer_Simpson: \\'Evening, Moe.\\nBarney_Gumble: \\'Morning, Moe.\\nChauffeur: Here we are, Mr. Gumbel.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, all right. Listen up, guys. The Springfield Police have told me that 91 per cent of all traffic accidents are caused by you six guys.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, I know, I know. But the bad news is we gotta start having designated drivers.\\nMoe_Szyslak: We\\'ll choose the same way they pick the Pope.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Everybody reach in and draw a pickled egg. Whoever gets the black egg stays sober tonight.\\nBarney_Gumble: NOOOOOOOOOO!\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO BARNEY) You got the black one.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey everybody, I\\'m Peter Pantsless! (LAUGHS)\\nBarney_Gumble: (PAINED MOAN) I can\\'t take this much longer. I gotta have a beer.\\nBarney_Gumble: (HORRIFIED) Oh, no. Oh, no. Not tonight. Not tonight!\\nDuffman: (PARTY VOICE) Are you ready to get Duffed?\\nLenny_Leonard: Hey, it\\'s Duffman! The guy in a costume that creates awareness of Duff!\\nDuffman: Duffman wants to party down with the man who sent in ten thousand Duff labels to bring me here today. I\\'ve got a bottomless mug of new \"Duff Extra Cold\" for... (READS CARD) BARNEY GUMBEL!\\nCheerleaders: (CHEERS AND:) Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!\\nBarney_Gumble: (STRAINING) I can\\'t!

Now, who wants to party?!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Face it, Homer, the car is gone. Barney ain\\'t never comin\\' back.\\nBarney_Gumble: (SHAKY) All I remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at Villanova. (BEAT) Or maybe it was a streetcorner.\\nHomer_Simpson: (QUIET ANGER) So you lost my car, eh? Well, that\\'s just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (COVERING) Uh, that\\'s a parasol.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, Moe, this is it. Today\\'s the day I get my new air conditioner.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Congratulations. Who\\'s the little chick?\\nLisa_Simpson: I\\'m Lisa!\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO MOE, PROUDLY) She has a gift.\\nLisa_Simpson: You have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar!

I\\'m countin\\' on that.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: Well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left...\\nHomer_Simpson: (CHECKING WATCH, CHIPPER) Actually, it\\'s more like twelve. No, I\\'m so stupid, seven. It\\'s seven hours. You have seven hours. (SHOWING APU WATCH) See? Seven.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: (SAD MOAN, THEN SINGING DIRGE-LIKE) \"WELL, I\\'M HOT BLOODED / CHECK IT AND SEE / I\\'VE GOT A FEVER OF A HUNDRED AND THREE...\"\\nHomer_Simpson: C\\'mon. You shouldn\\'t be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.\\nHomer_Simpson: You should be livin\\' like there\\'s no tomorrow. And I know just the place.\\nHomer_Simpson: Ahh. Is this the life, or what?\\nJasper_Beardly: (REACHING FOR A SWITCH) You want me to turn on the bubbles?\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from Sunday.

(TURNS TO CAMERA) \"Absolutely devastated.\" The words of a heart-broken mother. For there will be no fire truck for little Bart. No sweater for little Lisa. No Cajun sausage for little Homer...\\nKent_Brockman: (SNEERING) So while you\\'re home today eating your sweet, sweet holiday turkey, I hope you\\'ll all choke just a little bit.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So this was all a scam.

(TO MARGE) Marge, gimme your purse.\\nMarge_Simpson: (SOTTO; DESPERATE) Here\\'s $42 -- it\\'s everything I have. Run home and bury it in the yard.\\nLisa_Simpson: I love you, Mom!\\nCrowd: You tell \\'em, Krusty. / Screw everyone! / Etc.\\nBusinessman_#1: Wow, they\\'re hanging on his every word. (TURNS) Are you thinking what I\\'m thinking?\\nBusinessman_#2: I hope so.\\nBusinessman_#1: (FIRMLY) I thought I made myself clear in Boston.\\nLenny_Leonard: (TO HOMER) I brought a bag of money in case he wants us to burn it again.\\nHomer_Simpson: I hope he tells us to burn our pants. These things are drivin\\' me nuts!\\nKrusty_the_Clown: So this afternoon, two suits come up to me and ask me to endorse some new sports utility vehicle.\\nCrowd: Oooo! / What did you do? / (LAUGHS)\\nHomer_Simpson: (CALLING OUT) Don\\'t you hate pants?\\nKrusty_the_Clown: (IGNORING HOMER) I threw those two creeps out on their ass.\\nCrowd: Yeah! / Woo! / Go Krusty! / Woo hoo hoo!\\nKrusty_the_Clown: Then, they followed me home, begging me to take a test drive.

The Canyonero combines the smooth handling of a European sports car with the rugged driveability of a sturdy 4X4.\\nCrowd: (CONFUSED NOISES) / Huh? / What?\\nCarl_Carlson: (CALLING OUT) Hey, Krusty, what are you talking about? I, I thought you said those guys were creeps!\\nKrusty_the_Clown: Yeah, but that was before I got to know \\'em. And I\\'m tellin\\' ya\\', the Canyonero is the Cadillac of automobiles.

And all the blissful years I\\'ve spent hiding from her in this bar.\\nBarflies: Hear, hear!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah. Big deal. You got a wife. I got a rash. Who cares? (OFF HOMER\\'S HURT LOOK) Ech, I\\'m sorry, Homer. It\\'s just, it\\'s been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman.\\nHomer_Simpson: Whatever happened to your mail order bride?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a Micronesian swamp.\\nHomer_Simpson: So her career got in the way.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, I don\\'t blame her. (LOOKING IN MIRROR) No girl wants to end up with a Joe Puke-pail like me.\\nHomer_Simpson: Now, now, I won\\'t hear of it, Moe. You\\'re a fabulous catch.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SNORT) Yeah, well, uh, how come I ain\\'t fendin\\' off movie starlets with a pointy stick?\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, it\\'s probably due to your ugliness. But that doesn\\'t mean we can\\'t find you a woman. Come on, we\\'re goin\\' to the darkest bar in town.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Yeah, I wanna send her two dozen roses. And I wanna put something nice on the card, like, um, \"Renee, my treasure...\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: Shut up, or I\\'ll ram a stool down your throat! (INTO PHONE) Ah, nah, nah, no, I don\\'t want that on the card... Well, lemme hear how it sounds... Nah, nah, take it out. Take it out. And charge it to my Players Club card... Maxed out?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Look, I really need these flowers, okay? I got a real tenuous hold on my girlfriend here... Hello? Hello?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SIGH) Well, that\\'s it. It\\'s all over. Renee ain\\'t gonna wanna hang around with no Joe Pinchpenny.\\nHomer_Simpson: Aw, come on, Moe. Think of all you have to offer besides money.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (THINKS FOR A BEAT) Hmmm... I need cash, and lots of it. Um, all right, everybody, I\\'m calling in your bar tabs.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ya bunch of ungrateful ingrates! Ya--\\nMoe_Szyslak: (DISTRAUGHT) Ah, Homer, what am I gonna do? Renee\\'s my last chance for true love.\\nHomer_Simpson: If you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Nah, my car ain\\'t worth nothin\\'. (GETTING AN IDEA) But it is insured... For five grand... Homer, I need your help. You gotta steal this car and wreck it for me.\\nHomer_Simpson: Steal? Oh no, you got the wrong guy.\\nHomer_Simpson: (AWKWARDLY) You dropped somethin\\'.\\nMoe_Szyslak: C\\'mon, Homer! I\\'m one of your dearest friends! When everybody said you were too drunk to drive that time, who gave you your keys?\\nHomer_Simpson: (WARILY) Oh, you did. But -- I still don\\'t know... I can just imagine what Marge would say.\\nMarge_Simpson: Homer, I insist you steal that car.\\nHomer_Simpson: (FIRMLY) I\\'ll do it!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, here\\'s the plan. (PLACING ON BAR) This model car represents my car, huh? And this olive is you. Now...\\nHomer_Simpson: Mmmm... me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey! Hey! Aw, that\\'s great. Now the car\\'s gonna have to represent you, and, uh, this little toy man will represent the car.\\nMoe_Szyslak: All right, forget it!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Listen up, here. Tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you \"steal\" my car.\\nHomer_Simpson: What about the cops?\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'s the beauty part. Every cop in town\\'s gonna be on the Police Department\\'s Moonlight Charity Cruise. And I\\'m gonna be right there with \\'em.\\nHomer_Simpson: So, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Righ-- No, no. Wrong. Listen. While I\\'m on the boat with the perfect alibi, you steal my car, and park it on the railroad tracks. Then when the 10:15 train comes along...\\nMoe_Szyslak: WHAM! The insurance company pays off five thousand clams. I keep showing Renee the sweet life.\\nHomer_Simpson: You\\'re a genius, Moe. All your troubles will soon be over for a couple months.\\nMoe_Szyslak: ... So like a coward I let Homer take the rap for the whole scam. And now the only way to clear him is to turn myself in.\\nRenee: I-I don\\'t know what to say. I\\'m shocked. I mean you broke the law and betrayed a friend...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, you\\'re right. You shouldn\\'t be wasting your time with a low-life like me.\\nRenee: (GIVING IN) Oh, Moe, don\\'t say that. Y-You made a mistake, but at least you\\'re trying to set things straight.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, that\\'s true. That\\'s true, baby. Hmf, it\\'ll be hell being locked away from ya, but I guess I gotta take my medicine. (SUDDEN THOUGHT) Unless... Unless, I send a letter to the police clearing Homer...\\nRenee: (HOPEFUL) Yeah...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EXCITED) Then we go to the graveyard and steal two corpses...\\nRenee: (STUNNED) Oh my God.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (ON A ROLL) We-we-we switch clothes with them, leave \\'em in the bar. Then we pour some brandy around. Like so...\\nRenee: Yeah, would you hand me my keys?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, yeah. Here ya go.\\nMoe_Szyslak: ...Then we light a match...And FWOOOF! We start a new life in Hawaii.\\nRenee: Goodbye, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Where you goin\\', baby? You goin\\' to find the corpses?\\nRenee: (SARCASTIC) Yes, Moe, I\\'m going to find corpses.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, well, you want me to come with? Renee? Dearest? (BEAT, THEN REALIZING MOAN) (SIGH) She ain\\'t comin\\' back.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (YELP OF PAIN) Ow.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (HORRIFIED SCREAM) Uh-oh.\\nHomer_Simpson: (MURDEROUSLY) You!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer! Thank God, you gotta help me here!\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh-ho, I\\'ll help you. Help you die! (ATTACK YELL)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh! That\\'s it! You\\'re going down, pal!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, boy... Uh, I really wanna sleep...\\nHomer_Simpson: I... also sleep... G\\'night, Mommy...\\nBarney_Gumble: Moe! Homer! (SCREAMS) The booze!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, Homer, I been the world\\'s biggest rat. Can you ever forgive me?\\nHomer_Simpson: Ohh, I could never stay mad at you, Moe. (SINCERELY) After all, (TEARFULLY) you get me drunk.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (WATCHING FIRE) Aww! Ah, my poor bar. It\\'s all gone. (QUIET SOBBING)\\nHomer_Simpson: (PUTS ARM AROUND MOE) Aw, Moe, Moe, Moe, dry those beady little eyes. Your buddy Homer\\'ll get you back on your feet.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'ve joined the naval reserve.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, guys, I won\\'t be seeing you for a while.\\nBarney_Gumble: Where are you going?\\nBarney_Gumble: Well, I\\'m not gonna let anything happen to my best friend. I\\'m joining too.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, I\\'m not gonna let anything happen to my two best customers. I\\'m joining too.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: And although my religion strictly forbids military service -- what the hey, I\\'m in too.\\nHomer_Simpson: (TOUCHED) Gee, thanks guys. This is just like \"The Deer Hunter.\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: \"The Deer Hunter?\" Uh... hah... That reminds me.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: So Lenny, let\\'s say you pull a thorn out of the Pope\\'s butt and he grants ya one wish. What\\'ll it be?\\nLenny_Leonard: Hmm, only one, huh... Well, I\\'ve always wondered what it would feel like to wear something that\\'s been ironed.\\nCarl_Carlson: (WHISTLES) That\\'d be sweet. What about you, Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, gee, I was gonna say a night with Joey Heatherton. But an ironed shirt... Damn! That\\'s tempting.\\nLenny_Leonard: What about you, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: (LEANS BACK, THOUGHTFULLY) Well...\\nAgent_Miller: Homer Simpson? (FLASHING BADGE) United States Government.\\nHomer_Simpson: (PANICKY) Help! Somebody!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (WIPING GLASS) So how about you, Barn? One wish?\\nHomer_Simpson: So if my cover gets blown and I need help, what\\'s the signal?\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, I see you\\'re watchin\\' the ball game. Looks like a good one. Any of you involved in any illegal activity? Cause I could sure go for some.\\nAgent_Johnson: Oh, God!\\nHomer_Simpson: How \\'bout you, Lenny? Testing, testing? Lenny?\\nLenny_Leonard: You sayin\\' you want to commit a crime, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: Maybe. But first I need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.\\nCarl_Carlson: You mean like the time you was running moonshine out of your basement?\\nBarney_Gumble: Or that telemarketing scam you pulled?\\nHomer_Simpson: Uhhhh, like those. But involving you.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, you, you mean like the time Barney beat up George Bush.\\nHomer_Simpson: Barney? That was me! (SEETHING) And I\\'d do it again.\\nCharlie: Why stop there, Homer? My militia has a secret plan to beat up all sorts of government officials. That\\'ll teach \\'em to drag their feet on high-definition TV.\\nAgent_Johnson: You\\'re under arrest for conspiracy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, how did they finger Charlie? Somebody musta ratted him out.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, that\\'s ridiculous, Moe. End transmission.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOAN) My campaign is a disaster, Moe.\\nHomer_Simpson: (BITTER) I hate the public so much. (WISHFUL) If only they\\'d elect me... (VENGEFUL) I\\'d make \\'em pay. (WORRIED) Oh Moe, how do I make \\'em like me?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, gee, you\\'re kinda all over the place there, Homer. You need to focus here. You gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SHORT MOAN) Can\\'t someone else do it?\\nMoe_Szyslak: \"Can\\'t someone else do it?\" That\\'s perfect!\\nHomer_Simpson: It is?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah. Now get out there and spread that message to the people!\\nHomer_Simpson: (RAISES ARMS TRIUMPHANTLY) Woo hoo!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Whoa, whoa, hey, you didn\\'t pay for the beer.\\nHomer_Simpson: (BIG SMILE, STAGY) Can\\'t someone else do it?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (BIG KNOWING LAUGH) / Very good.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Seriously, gimme the money.\\nU2: THE SANITATION FOLKS / ARE JOLLY FRIENDLY BLOKES / COURTEOUS AND EASYGOING.\\nThe_Edge: THEY MOP UP WHEN YOU\\'RE OVERFLOWING...\\nBono: AND TELL YOU WHEN YOUR ARSE IS SHOWING.\\n\\n\\nLenny_Leonard: So this broad stands up... in the ocean and this big wave knocks her bathing suit off.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ooh. Yeah. And then what happened? Omit no detail, no matter how small or filthy.\\nLenny_Leonard: So anyway -- and this is the part you\\'ll remember for the rest of your lives...\\nHomer_Simpson: (CUTTING HIM OFF) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, great story, Lenny. But here\\'s one that\\'s even more spellbinding. Once upon a time there was a man named Thomas Edison. And he invented the dictating machine and the fluoroscope and the repeating telegraph...\\nHomer_Simpson: (INCREASINGLY BREATHLESS) ... And he was a firm believer in Fletcherism, and he played the organ, and his favorite flower was the heliotrope -- oh, and his middle name was Alva. And he never, ever, ever wore pajamas. And...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, I think we\\'ve been polite long enough here. Lenny, what happened with the dame and the bathing suit?\\nLenny_Leonard: Huh? Oh... uh... oh, nuts. I forgot. All I can think of now is Edison. I can\\'t even remember where I work. (RUBS TEMPLES)\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, I remember where Edison worked. It was Menlo Park. That\\'s where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and...\\nCarl_Carlson: Uh, James Watt invented the steam engine.\\nHomer_Simpson: That\\'s boring. You\\'re boring everybody. Quit boring everyone!\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (UPBEAT) Ah, morning, Homer. Ah, you\\'re looking unusually focused this morning.\\nHomer_Simpson: Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I\\'m gonna, like, totally waste you.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, somebody\\'s a Grumpy Gus. What\\'s--\\nHomer_Simpson: Yoink.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ooh! (PEEVED) Ah, for crying out loud. (GASP)\\nKent_Brockman: Another of Springfield\\'s beloved citizens was murdered today. Filthy old bartender Moe Szyslak has watered down his last highball.\\n\\n\\nBarflies: (EXCITED SOUNDS) / My God, what I\\'d give to meet him.\\nCarl_Carlson: Oh, they don\\'t come much bigger than that.\\nHomer_Simpson: (DERISIVE SNORT) Kent Brockman. Please.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, I\\'m in the grocery store the other day buyin\\' some cotton balls...\\nCarl_Carlson: The absorbent kind?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (PROUDLY) Youuu got that right, my friend!\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, I round the corner and head down the ointment aisle, when who should I spot? None other than Kent Brockman!\\nLenny_Leonard: (IMPRESSED) The local news guy? Mister Channel 6?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, what? I suppose you\\'ve seen a bigger star?\\nHomer_Simpson: (COY) I might have.\\nLenny_Leonard: Come on, make with a name.\\nHomer_Simpson: (PAINED) Oh, I can\\'t. I promised I wouldn\\'t.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (DISMISSIVE NOISE) Aw, yeah right. You ain\\'t seen nobody.\\nBarney_Gumble: Another good one, Moe.\\nKim_Basinger: Please don\\'t tell anyone we\\'re here.\\nAlec_Baldwin: You\\'ve got to keep our secret, Homer.\\nRon_Howard: Homer, we\\'re out of vodka.\\nGentleman: (STATESMANLIKE) Tell the people, Homer. They have a right to know about the celebrity summer house.\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO THOUGHT BUBBLE) Who the hell are you?\\nGentleman: What do you care? I\\'m telling you what you want to hear.\\nHomer_Simpson: All right, I\\'m gonna let you guys in on something. But you\\'ve got to keep it much more secret than I did.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, I gotta hand it to you, Homer. You\\'re really brave to go through with this operation.\\nHomer_Simpson: It\\'s not an operation, Moe. The doctor says it\\'s just a procedure.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Nah, nah, no. Makin\\' polenta, that\\'s a procedure. You\\'re talkin\\' about deadly, life-threatening surgery, here.\\nHomer_Simpson: (GETTING NERVOUS) Really? You think it\\'s dangerous?\\nCarl_Carlson: Oh, yeah. And, and even if you survive the operation --\\nHomer_Simpson: (CORRECTING) Procedure. Deadly procedure.\\nCarl_Carlson: Whatever. The point is, with only one kidney, you won\\'t be able to drink yourself stupid no more.\\nHomer_Simpson: Now you\\'re just tryin\\' to scare me.\\nLenny_Leonard: Plus they\\'ll put you on one of those organ donor sucker lists. Everybody who wants an eyeball or a spine or a vestigial tail will be after you.\\nHomer_Simpson: (PLAINTIVE) But I don\\'t want that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Listen, I\\'m just gonna get right to the point, here. Can I have your buttocks? I mean, if you die. They look pretty comfortable.\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOROSE) Yeah, I guess.\\nCarl_Carlson: And, uh, are those your original lips?\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, actually I-- (CATCHING HIMSELF) Hey! Quit harvesting me with your eyes! (OFFENDED NOISE)\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EYEING HOMER\\'S ASS) Oh yeah, that would look so good on me.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (HOSTILE) Hey Homer, I told you not to come \\'round here no more till you paid your tab. Or at least cleaned up that mess you made in the bathroom. Now y--\\nMoe_Szyslak: (TURNING ON A DIME) Mayor Quimby?! Homer, why didn\\'t you say you was with the mayor?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Shove off, puke-holes. Get out of there! These stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Heh. Here\\'s a couple of Düffenbraus, on the house, of course.\\nHomer_Simpson: (IMPRESSED NOISE) Semi-imported. (GUZZLES THE BOTTLE) Keep \\'em comin\\'.\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: (TO MOE) Your generosity is greatly appreciated, especially during this health inspection season.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh yeah, yeah, right. Health inspection. That reminds me. (CHUCKLES)\\nMoe_Szyslak: (STAGEY) Your change, sir.\\nMoe_Szyslak: We\\'re workin\\' on that roach situation, I swear to God.\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: (SHRUGGING) Eh, you should see the hospital.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (GRUNT) What\\'s the hubub? Did Moe finally blow his brains out?\\nLenny_Leonard: Quiet! We\\'re watchin\\' the Isotopes!\\nHomer_Simpson: Shut it off. They\\'re losers.\\nCarl_Carlson: Where you been? The Isotopes are on fire!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, that sniper at the all-star game was a blessing in disguise.\\nLenny_Leonard: Now we\\'re in the championship game.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SURPRISED) Championship?\\nHomer_Simpson: Wooooo! \\'Topes ruuuule!\\nKent_Brockman: Well, here\\'s a die-hard fan. Sir, your beloved Isotopes are about to make history. Any thoughts?\\nHomer_Simpson: (WINDED EXCITEMENT) Oh, it\\'s a great team, Kent... never gave up hope... I want to thank Jesus... and say hi to my special lady Marge... (INTO CAMERA) We did it, baby! Wooooo! (GRABBING BROCKMAN\\'S MICROPHONE) Woooooo!\\nKent_Brockman: (TO CAMERA) The inspiring words of a fan who\\'ll always root, root, root for the home team, even if they lose this ga--\\nHomer_Simpson: They lost? Those losers!\\nKent_Brockman: No, no, no, the game\\'s not over --\\nHomer_Simpson: Woo! Not over! Wooooo!\\nKent_Brockman: (TO CAMERA) There you have it. Woo.\\nDennis_Conroy: (ABOVE CROWD) Bottom of the ninth, two outs. It all comes down to this. And here\\'s the pitch...\\nDennis_Conroy: (SPANISH \"J\"\\'S) Jumping Jesus! He got all of that one! It\\'s going... going... going...\\nDennis_Conroy: (QUICKLY) Our technical director today was Stan Kadlubowski.\\nDennis_Conroy: (BACK ON GAME) It\\'s out of here! \\'Topes win!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (HURT SIGH) Nobody touched my rumaki.\\nHomer_Simpson: Woo! Rumaki!\\n\\n\\nSports_Announcer: The road to the Super Bowl is long and pointless. I mean, when you think about it...\\nHomer_Simpson: (CHUCKLES AT INJURY) Football\\'s so great. (SIPS BEER)\\nSports_Announcer: But now the two conference champs must survive a harrowing bye week that no one enjoys.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SCORNFUL) Bye weeks. Bronco Nagurski didn\\'t get no bye weeks. And now he\\'s dead. (RECONSIDERING) Well, maybe they\\'re a good thing.\\nWally: Yeah, how \\'bout that Super Bowl? You goin\\' this year?\\nHomer_Simpson: Me? Nah. (GASP, BRIGHTENING) Unless there\\'s a coupon for it. (FLIPS THROUGH BOOK) Nah.\\nWally: Well, I run the Springfield Travel Agency.\\nWally: We\\'ve got a charter bus goin\\' down to the game. You help us fill it, you can ride for free.\\nHomer_Simpson: (DREAMILY) Homer Simpson at the Super Bowl?\\nCoach: Dang! That was my last quarterback. Now what am I gonna do?\\nCoach: You!\\nHomer_Simpson: Me?!\\nCoach: Yeah, you. Get your hand off my wife\\'s leg.\\nHomer_Simpson: Sorry.\\nHomer_Simpson: It\\'s a deal. Hey, Moe. Wanna come with me and Wally to the Super Bowl?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EXCITED) Oh, absolutely. My favorite team\\'s in it: the (RAISES GLASS IN FRONT OF MOUTH) Atlanta Falcons (LOWERS GLASS). Yeah, ever since I was a boy, I\\'ve always loved the (RAISES GLASS IN FRONT OF MOUTH AGAIN) Atlanta Falcons (LOWERS GLASS).\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah, they\\'re good. But I wouldn\\'t count out the... Denver Broncos (LOWERS GLASS).\\nWally: I hear that President (GRABS GLASS FROM HOMER AND COVERS MOUTH) Clinton (LOWERS GLASS) is going to be watching with his wife (RAISES GLASS IN FRONT OF MOUTH) Hillary (LOWERS GLASS).\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, uh, what kind of adventure you gonna be involved in tonight, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: Mmm, who knows? Maybe I\\'ll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So they really based that Homer Simpson character on you, huh?\\nHomer_Simpson: Yup. Right down to the scarf.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ooh, there it is!\\nChief_Wiggum: Nice beating, Lance. Especially around the eyes. (THEN) Say, where\\'s your partner? Where\\'s Homer Simpson?\\nDETECTIVE_HOMER_SIMPSON: Coming, Chief.\\nChief_Wiggum: Now what have you done, Simpson?\\nDETECTIVE_HOMER_SIMPSON: I was supervising the guns for toys program.\\nChief_Wiggum: It\\'s toys for guns.\\nDETECTIVE_HOMER_SIMPSON: Now you tell me!\\nChief_Wiggum: (EXASPERATED) Simp-sonnnn!!\\nHomer_Simpson: (CONFUSED) Hey, what\\'s going on? That guy\\'s not Homer Simpson. He\\'s fat and stupid.\\nLenny_Leonard: Hey, looks like they changed the character into a bumbling sidekick.\\nHomer_Simpson: (WORRIED) No, no, he can\\'t be. I know, maybe he\\'s just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. Yeah, that\\'s gotta be it.\\nChief_Wiggum: You destroyed that drug shipment?\\nDETECTIVE_HOMER_SIMPSON: (PROUDLY) Yes indeedy.\\nChief_Wiggum: (ANGRY) That was my insulin!\\nDETECTIVE_HOMER_SIMPSON: (HAPLESSLY) Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O\\'s!\\nChief_Wiggum: (EXASPERATED) Simp-sonnnn!!\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey Homer, that character is you all over.\\nLenny_Leonard: Come on, Homer, act all stupid.

And to think I was about to sell the bar to Hooters...\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah, you were... (ANNOYED GRUNT)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, I guess that wraps it up. Hey, there\\'s one thing I don\\'t get, though. When my face was crushed, why did it go back to my old face? I mean, shouldn\\'t it have turned into some kind of third face that was different? Heh.

It\\'s cheaper than blank tape.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, but they come over here in the wheel wells of Aer Lingus jets.\\nCarl_Carlson: Yeah, but a lot harder to catch. Uh, go with the leprechaun.\\nHomer_Simpson: Guys, I am not cursed!\\nLenny_Leonard: (DYING) Carl, let me die first.

If it\\'s true, what about all the stuff you weren\\'t around for?\\nLenny_Leonard: Yeah.

You\\'re always pointing that shotgun at us.\\nLenny_Leonard: And callin\\' us dumb-asses...\\nCarl_Carlson: Which we\\'re so not.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (LOWERS GUN) But, can you blame me? Every day it\\'s the same old routine. I serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and I never get one stinkin\\' tip.\\nHomer_Simpson: Maybe we\\'d tip you if you\\'d smile once in a while.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What d\\'ya call this?\\nCarl_Carlson: Shesh, don\\'t do that!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, who am I kiddin\\'? I ain\\'t smiled for real since I nailed that rat with the ice pick. Ha, remember that?\\nHomer_Simpson: That was an amazing throw.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ahh! How did I lose my passion for the job? When I was in bartending school, I thought I had the world by the jigger.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, where\\'d that painting come from?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, I put this up recently, and it\\'s a good thing I did, \\'cause it really illustrates my point.

Human feeling.\\nLenny_Leonard: Yeah, maybe you should, uh... what\\'s the expression? Go back there.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s the word I\\'m searching for? Uh... yeah!

I gotta pay for that!\\nHomer_Simpson: No Moe. You\\'ve got it all wrong. People buy beer from you.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EXASPERATED SIGH) All right, look, I-I gotta go.\\nHomer_Simpson: (MATTER-OF-FACT) I thought you said you had to go.\\nHomer_Simpson: Man, when\\'s the last time Moe cleaned this?\\nCarl_Carlson: Hey, Homer!

Swings in the old battin\\' cage. (PERVERTED NOISE)\\nLenny_Leonard: Looks like everyone\\'s a winner.

Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?\\nCarl_Carlson: I\\'d dump your ass.\\nLenny_Leonard: Me too.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, I can\\'t get Artie out of my head.

You just have to drown it out.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SINGS) I\\'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE RAILROAD / ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY... (THEN) Yeah, that\\'s better.\\nHomer_Simpson: (WEARY) Oh man, what a day.

We\\'d be too late to save Lincoln and too early to save Kennedy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: You could save McKinley.\\nHomer_Simpson: It\\'s not a time machine, Moe.\\n\\n\\nCarl_Carlson: Say, Bob, how come you were never able to kill Bart?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, a kid should be real simple to kill.\\nLenny_Leonard: I\\'d just come up behind him with a knife and slit his throat real quick-like.\\nHomer_Simpson: Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.\\nSideshow_Bob: Homer, if I could write Haikus while skinheads beat me with soap, I can concentrate anywhere.\\n\\n\\nLenny_Leonard: Gee Homer, you sure look sad.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, at least you ain\\'t aging six years for every one \\'cause of your cow heart.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, my daughter hates me because I don\\'t know anything about her.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, well, whenever I gotta know something about a broad, I use this guy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: This detective is unbelievable. He can learn more about a chick by digging through one garbage can than you could from years of intimacy.\\nCarl_Carlson: He found out who was cobbling shoes for me at night. Turns out I have severe schizophrenia.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well... if hiring this guy will make Lisa like me again, then I\\'ll do it! Can I get this beer to go?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Sure. Maybe some day I\\'ll turn into a swan.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SIGH) Oh, God.\\n\\n\\nMarge_Simpson: So then I pop my delts, clench and bam! Not a dry eye in the house.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, I\\'m so proud of you, honey. You bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity.\\nMarge_Simpson: (FIERCE) And that\\'s why I didn\\'t win!\\nHomer_Simpson: Sorry, sir, sorry.\\nMarge_Simpson: Starting tomorrow, I\\'m gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel...\\nHomer_Simpson: (FRIGHTENED) Denser?!\\nMarge_Simpson: Damn straight, I didn\\'t sacrifice my period for second place!\\nLenny_Leonard: (AWKWARD CHUCKLE) I hear that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh, listen Marge, how can I put this delicately? I don\\'t got enough booze in this place to make you look good.\\nMarge_Simpson: Maybe death will stop your yammering!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Marge, easy!\\nLenny_Leonard: Everyone pile on Homer\\'s wife!\\nDisco_Stu: (INSIDE JUKEBOX) Disco Stu should have Disco Ducked.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: I gave Mr. Burns the best years of my life. And how much respect does he give me?\\nLenny_Leonard: Slim to bupkus.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Who\\'s this Burns guy? Somebody you work with?\\nHomer_Simpson: (PERPLEXED) Moe, we\\'ve been complaining about him every night for eight years.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, if this guy\\'s ridin\\' your rump, why don\\'t you slap him some payback?\\nHomer_Simpson: Revenge? On Mr. Burns?\\nLenny_Leonard: Yeah, send him magazine subscriptions he don\\'t want.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Or give him some face time with sweet lady brick. (CHUCKLES)\\nHomer_Simpson: No, I think this calls for something a little more cerebral.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay you filthy booze-bags, it\\'s two a.m. So uh, who\\'s the designated driver?\\nLenny_Leonard: It was Andy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (VICTORIOUS CHUCKLE) No one\\'s ever won Moe\\'s \"Drink A Gallon Of Gin Challenge.\" And no one ever will.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, life is good.\\nLenny_Leonard: Hey, what happened? It\\'s bright in the middle of the night.\\nCarl_Carlson: You know what this reminds me of? My Icelandic boyhood.\\nHomer_Simpson: It\\'s this new anti-crime dealie. The mayor turned the streetlights way up. My daughter Lisa feels really strongly about it.\\nLenny_Leonard: Pro or con?\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'unno. What am I, Superdad?\\n\\n\\nYoung_Moe: Welcome to Moe\\'s. Home of the finest bar crystal in Springfield.\\nYoung_Moe: I shouldn\\'t have cheaped out on the shelf.\\nHomer_Simpson: I can\\'t believe how young we looked... in my memory.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, there\\'s writing on the back of this.\\nHomer_Simpson: (READING) \"Dear Homer, I can\\'t believe you\\'re making this the worst night of my life.\" (VERY PUZZLED NOISE)\\nParamedic: Young man, you\\'ve ingested a dangerous amount of alcohol.\\nHomer_Simpson: (DEFIANTLY) The only dangerous amount is none!\\nHomer_Simpson: Let\\'s go to IHOP! I\\'m drivin\\'.\\nHomer_Simpson: Okay, Burger King! Whatever! C\\'mon.\\nHomer_Simpson: (ABSENTMINDEDLY GOING THROUGH BOX) Why did she stay with me if she hated me so much? Hey, two days later she had a doctor\\'s appointment.\\nYoung_Marge: You leave me sitting here all alone...\\nYoung_Marge: (WRITING) ...while you play video games with your Neanderthal friends.\\nYoung_Marge: Why don\\'t you just stop playing?\\nYoung_Marge: Homer, I really don\\'t want to feed you.\\nYoung_Marge: (UPSET) Video games and too much beer. You sure know how to show a girl a good time.\\nYoung_Marge: Tonight I learned the two of us can\\'t work.\\nMarge_Simpson: James Taylor. Homie, remember that song we used to sing?\\nMarge_Simpson: (SINGS) MOCK...\\nHomer_Simpson: (FLATLY) Yeah.\\nMarge_Simpson: (SINGS) ING...\\nHomer_Simpson: (FLATLY) Yeah.\\nMarge_Simpson: (SINGS) BIRD...\\nHomer_Simpson: (FLATLY) Whatever.\\nMarge_Simpson: Homie, what\\'s wrong?\\nHomer_Simpson: (TENTATIVE) Marge... did I ruin your life?\\nMarge_Simpson: Oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?\\nHomer_Simpson: No, the voters will decide that in November. I was talking about this.\\nMarge_Simpson: Huh?\\nMarge_Simpson: (BUSTED) Oh my God, I forgot all about this. Where did you find it?\\nHomer_Simpson: More like, where didn\\'t I find it. It was practically everywhere.\\nMarge_Simpson: Homer, I\\'m sorry you saw that, but I was very upset that night.\\nHomer_Simpson: Quit changing the subject. How do you feel about me right now?\\nMarge_Simpson: Well, I love you, of course. But a lot of things you do still drive me crazy.\\nHomer_Simpson: So you mean our whole marriage you\\'ve just been resenting me behind my back?\\nMarge_Simpson: A little bit, yeah.\\nHomer_Simpson: Fine. I\\'ll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.\\nHomer_Simpson: You know, Moe, I was just thinking. My problems with Marge started because I drink too much. And then tonight alcohol only made things worse. Maybe all of my problems are actually caused by...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take your medicine, ya lush ya.\\n\\n\\nCarl_Carlson: (SHOUT) F-L-A-N-R-D-S!\\nHomer_Simpson: (SINGS) HE\\'S THE MAN THAT I HATE BEST / I\\'D LIKE TO SEE HIS HOUSE GO UP IN FLAME!\\nDavid_Byrne: Excuse me, I\\'ve been researching indigenous folk music of Springfield, and I couldn\\'t help overhearing your delightfully cruel hate song.\\nCarl_Carlson: (AMAZED) David Byrne?!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (AMAZED) Singer, artist, composer, director, Talking Head...\\nDavid_Byrne: And, I used to wrestle under the name \"El Diablo.\"\\nLenny_Leonard: I thought that was Philip Glass.\\nDavid_Byrne: Yeah, he wishes.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, Mister? If you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? (SELLING) It\\'s already rewound.\\nDavid_Byrne: No thanks. But I would like to sing it with you and produce it.\\nHomer_Simpson: (ROLLS EYES, ANNOYED) Fine.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Our little hero sure likes Kahlua and Cream.\\nHomer_Simpson: Quit following me, you coward!\\nMoe_Szyslak: You heard \\'im, fleabag. Get outta my bar, you\\'re unsanitary.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, how precious. The cat\\'s sittin\\' in my dinner.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No, no, don\\'t get up, sweetheart. I\\'ll just, I\\'ll just pick around you. There we go.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: I don\\'t think he\\'s here... hang on, let me check.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Nope. (SHORT BEAT) Whatcha wearin\\'?\\nHomer_Simpson: I did it. I walked all the way to Moe\\'s from my house.\\nBart_Simpson: Way to go, Dad!\\nHomer_Simpson: You know, I feel pretty good. Maybe I should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Get in here, boozy. You\\'re late for your drunkening.\\nHomer_Simpson: No. From now on, walking is my beer. And feeling good is my hangover.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Huh. Hey maybe this is a sign. Maybe it\\'s time for me to get out of the alcohol business. Give barber college another try -- and this time I won\\'t join a frat.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Who the hell am I talkin\\' to?\\nLisa_Simpson: You know what Mom really loves? Julienne potatoes. And for dessert, peach crumble.\\nMoe_Szyslak: You wanna know how to make a peach crumble? Kick it in the groin. Ha, anyway, what\\'s goin\\' on?\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'m gonna treat Marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings.\\nLenny_Leonard: Hey, Homer. If you\\'re havin\\' a banquet for Marge, I\\'d like to help.\\nCarl_Carlson: Hey, me too. I could whip up my famous poulet au vin avec champignons à la Carl. (HE KISSES HIS HAND)\\nHomer_Simpson: You can bring a bag of ice.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'s odd. It\\'s eleven fifteen in the morning and the bar is empty.\\nKent_Brockman: I\\'m live at Springfield Botanical Gardens, where we\\'re minutes away from the blossoming of the Sumatran Century Flower, which only occurs once every hundred years.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, those are my customers-slash-only friends! Where are they getting their beer?\\nMoe_Szyslak: A cooler! I\\'ve been replaced by a cooler!\\nMoe_Szyslak: And who could blame \\'em?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, no point in mopin\\' around. I might as well join \\'em and have a jolly old time.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Better set the alarm.\\nLenny_Leonard: You still got us, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: You guys mind if I uh... kiss your tummies?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Boy, I\\'m like a mess here. I feel so lonely without that kid.\\nElves: (SING) TOYS AND CAKES AND PETS AND BROTHERHOOD...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SOBS) It\\'s our song.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SIGH) If I knew this would take so long, I\\'d\\'a put on the TV.\\nDelivery_Boy: Pizza!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Y\\'money\\'s on the counter. No tip.\\nDelivery_Boy: You miserable bastard.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'s why I\\'m up here.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (PROUDLY) Hey guys, I brought my Mom.\\nMona_Simpson: Lenny Leonard? I haven\\'t seen you since you were this high.\\nCarl_Carlson: (COMPETITIVE) I can jump off the high dive!\\nMona_Simpson: (WARMLY) Carl Carlson, I remember when you, Lenny and Stevie MacGregor were like the Three Musketeers.\\nCarl_Carlson: (SADLY) Yeah, poor Stevie. They never found his head.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (ACCUSING) Mrs. Simpson, when you took off, you left a hole in Homer\\'s heart that he\\'s been trying to fill with alcohol for twenty years... (THEN WARMLY) God bless ya.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: To old man Burns, who\\'s paying us to drink because we\\'re embarrassing!\\nCarl_Carlson: (TOASTING) We suck!\\nHomer_Simpson: (WOOZY) A lot of that went in my lungs.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: Attention American bar devils: it\\'s our anniversary! Free drinks for everyone!\\nHomer_Simpson: That\\'s great. I\\'m honored to drink to Apu and, uh... Apulina.\\nHomer_Simpson: You know, Marge and I have an anniversary coming up.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: I have given Manjula many gifts, including a bouquet of flowers, diamond earrings, and we\\'re going to see Paris... Hilton. In Paris... Texas. On our way to Paris, France.\\nManjula_Nahasapeemapetilon: What did you plan to get your wife, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: (SHEEPISH) These charity address labels that came in the mail.\\nHomer_Simpson: (DRUNK) I don\\'t wanna go home! I\\'m not done talking to me!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Just get out this door, rummy, and you\\'re the city\\'s problem. If you make it through the night, you\\'re welcome back.\\nHomer_Simpson: Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.\\nSociety_Matron: Oh, you poor soul. You think that rat is a remote.\\nHomer_Simpson: Five bucks? I don\\'t need your sharity! I\\'ll dance for my money!\\nWoman_Bystander: Oh you poor man, you think you can dance.\\nWoman_Bystander: I didn\\'t say stop!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Guys, I\\'d like you to meet Artie Ziff.\\nAristotle: Hello, handsome!\\nArtie_Ziff: Hello... (UNDER BREATH) losers.\\nLenny_Leonard: Okay, read \\'em and weep.\\nArtie_Ziff: I don\\'t know why I\\'m losing. Maybe I have some kind of \"tell.\" (LOOKS AT CARDS) Hot mamma, I\\'m livin\\' in flush-town, (JUMPS ON TABLE) population Artie!\\nArtie_Ziff: (NONCHALANT) I guess I\\'m in for fifty cents.\\nBarney_Gumble: I fold. / Me too. / I\\'m out. / I\\'m done.\\nHomer_Simpson: (CONFIDENT) I\\'ll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.\\nArtie_Ziff: Well, I\\'m out of cash. But would you accept ninety-eight per cent of the outstanding shares of ZiffCorp stock?\\nHomer_Simpson: And the peanuts in your mouth.\\nArtie_Ziff: Very well.\\nArtie_Ziff: (LOUD) Achem!\\nHomer_Simpson: All of them.\\nArtie_Ziff: (NOT SO LOUD) Achem!\\nArtie_Ziff: Flush. What have you got?\\nHomer_Simpson: Four jacks.\\nHomer_Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Check it out! I own a multi-national corporation. (CHUCKLES) I always knew some day I\\'d be a C.O.D.\\nSec_Agent_#1: Freeze! Securities and Exchange Commission!\\nSec_Agent_#2: Artie Ziff, you\\'re wanted for stock manipulation and securities fraud.\\nSec_Agent_#1: (MACHO) It\\'s scum like you that undermine investor confidence.\\nHomer_Simpson: Investor confidence? Perhaps this affects me -- I own two hundred and thirty million shares of ZiffCorp stock.\\nSec_Agent_#1: You\\'re the majority shareholder?\\nHomer_Simpson: (UPBEAT) I sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.\\nSec_Agent_#2: You\\'re under arrest!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Wait a minute. How can you arrest Homer? (POINTS TO ARTIE) This guy\\'s the one what done the thing that why you\\'re here for. I\\'m talkin\\' malfeasance here.\\nArtie_Ziff: (SINCERE) All right, I admit it. I did run ZiffCorp into the ground. (PUTS ARM AROUND HOMER) Then this man took me into his home when no one else would. And now, as a result of his brilliant card playing (QUICKLY) he\\'s the one you want! Tape his mouth so he can\\'t deny it!\\nHomer_Simpson: (DISTRAUGHT) Don\\'t tell my kids I\\'m going to jail! Tell them I\\'ve joined the Blue Man Group! I\\'m the fat one!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, well look who showed his face. The louse who sold out his only friend. You\\'ve got a lot of nerve comin\\' here... (FRIENDLY) but since you did, what\\'ll it be? First one\\'s on the house.\\nPatty_Bouvier: Is this dump open? We were jogging and we ran out of cigarettes.\\nArtie_Ziff: Pardon me for intruding, but I believe teenage girls shouldn\\'t smoke.\\nSelma_Bouvier: Are you still livin\\' with Marge?\\nArtie_Ziff: No. She kicked me out for sending her husband to prison.\\nSelma_Bouvier: You put Homer in jail? (SWOONING) The hair is standing up on the back of my knees.\\nPatty_Bouvier: Keep your Odor Eaters on, Selma. I\\'ve seen you get hurt too many times.\\nSelma_Bouvier: I\\'m not gonna let him into my heart, or my bedroom. Just ten minutes on the beanbag. C\\'mon, Short Round. We\\'re goin\\' back to my Temple of Doom.\\nArtie_Ziff: Be gentle!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (HOPEFUL) You know, they say that the love of a good woman can save any man.\\nPatty_Bouvier: Except you, freak.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, if you change your mind, you know where I am.\\nPatty_Bouvier: In my nightmares.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m gonna stop now.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Two glasses of wine, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Wine? Jeez. No one ever orders that. Umm...\\nMoe_Szyslak: All I got is this old stuff here. (READING LABEL, CONTEMPTUOUS) Chateau Latour -- eighteen eighty-six? Oh, I should just throw this out.\\nMarge_Simpson: No, it\\'ll have to do.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'ll be four bucks.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Now, in a step I perhaps should have taken initially, let me look up the value of that bottle in this wine collector\\'s guide.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SOBS) Oh, what have I done? Lemme dry my tears with this lost Shakespeare play.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Where\\'s your wife tonight, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: She\\'s not coming anymore.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What? It\\'s \\'cause of her I put in a bidet. Well, it\\'s actually just a step ladder by the water fountain.\\nHomer_Simpson: Listen, Moe. I did something really terrible to someone I love.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, look. I\\'ve been in the bartender business for a long time alright, I\\'ve heard it all.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, what I did was...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SHOCKED) What are you? You\\'re like a monster! That\\'s like the worst thing I ever heard anybody do to anybody. You should be drinkin\\' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SOBS) Can I have some peanuts?\\nMoe_Szyslak: All right, but I get to poke you with a stick.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (WHILE POKING, FRIENDLY) So, hey, did you see the game last night?\\n\\n\\nSeymour_Skinner: Homer, this bachelor party seems to have peaked. Would you please return my pants and/or underpants so I can go home?\\nHomer_Simpson: Come on, it\\'s your last night of freedom. You gotta have some fun.\\nSeymour_Skinner: Who are all of you people?\\nCarl_Carlson: We\\'re your buddies! Now come on, Homer\\'s kids\\' principal, have a beer!\\nSeymour_Skinner: I can\\'t -- I might be called upon to give directions later.\\nGary_Chalmers: Skinner!\\nGary_Chalmers: You were asked to chug-a-lug. And a-lug you shall chug!\\nSeymour_Skinner: (BOOZY) There\\'s something I\\'ve wanted to say to you for a long time. (SUDDENLY NEEDY) Am I a good principal?\\nGary_Chalmers: (KINDLY) You\\'re the best we could get with the funds at our disposal.\\nSeymour_Skinner: (BOISTEROUS DRUNK) You know I wish I had an exciting life... like that class picture photographer. Ho, how many women has he had in that van? Two, that I know of.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Let\\'s kick this up a notch and get you some wiggle in your lap.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh yeah.\\nSeymour_Skinner: No. Absolutely no friction dancing!\\nBarney_Gumble: Aw, c\\'mon. What\\'re you, Killjoy!\\nLenny_Leonard: Wussy!\\nCarl_Carlson: Grinch.\\nHomer_Simpson: (CONSOLING) Hey, take it easy on Skinner. He\\'s just down \\'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong.\\nCarl_Carlson: Aw, marriage is gonna be great. Now you\\'ll have someone who\\'ll rub your back... without being asked.\\nLenny_Leonard: (SHAKING HEAD) Not this again.\\nCarl_Carlson: Yes, this again!\\nSeymour_Skinner: You know, Homer, Edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and I picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield.\\nHomer_Simpson: What are you trying to tell me, Skinner?\\nSeymour_Skinner: Homer, Lenny...my man... I could never lie to you guys. I\\'m starting to get cold feet. Please don\\'t tell anyone.\\nHomer_Simpson: (MEANINGFUL) Don\\'t worry. Your secret\\'s safe with me.\\nHomer_Simpson: Marge, guess what! Skinner wants to bail on his wedding!\\nSeymour_Skinner: Homer, you\\'re still talking to me!\\nHomer_Simpson: (SHEEPISH) Oh man, is this awkward. I\\'m outta here.\\nSeymour_Skinner: Oh God, I\\'ve lost the love of my life. Bart\\'s right, I am a wiener.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Geez, Homer, this guy is bringin\\' the whole bar down. I finally got Barney back on the sauce. If he doesn\\'t have fun, he could easily slip right back into sobriety.\\nBarney_Gumble: Don\\'t worry. If I feel the urge to sober up, I just talk to my sponsor.\\nWhite_Rabbit: (PETER LORRE VOICE) Drink or I\\'ll die.\\nHomer_Simpson: Wait a minute. I thought you didn\\'t wanna get married.\\nSeymour_Skinner: That was before I missed her smell, her warmth, her beautiful, beautiful penmanship!\\nHomer_Simpson: Don\\'t worry, Principal Skinner.\\nSeymour_Skinner: Seymour.\\nHomer_Simpson: Really? Boy, it sucks to be you. Anyhoo, if there\\'s one thing I know, it\\'s how to win back a furious woman. We\\'ll go to her house, and I\\'ll whisper to you exactly what to say.\\nSeymour_Skinner: Really? You\\'ll be my Cyrano?\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, if we get your girlfriend back I won\\'t have to.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, guys.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, cold shoulder, huh? Well, I\\'ll just talk to myself. (LOW VOICE) Hey, how ya doin\\', Homer? (HOMER\\'S VOICE) Oh, not too bad, how about you? (LOW VOICE) Oh I\\'m fine. Your wife was great in bed last night. (HOMER\\'S VOICE) You keep your hands off my wife! (LOW VOICE) Oh yeah? Well I give her what she needs. And she likes...\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, Homer, stop it!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer... this bar\\'s only for real Americans. And people on permanent visas, like me. What? What are you all lookin\\' at? I\\'m Dutch. Eh, forget all of you.\\nLenny_Leonard: I\\'m leavin\\', too. I\\'m gonna go listen to the President\\'s weekly radio address. And not the rebuttal!\\nCarl_Carlson: Goodbye, Homer. I can\\'t get drunk and vomit next to a guy I don\\'t respect.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SOBS) Even my best friends have left me! I\\'m all alone!\\n\\n\\nLenny_Leonard: Huh, maybe Burns ain\\'t so great.\\nCarl_Carlson: This little girl has given us a lot to mull.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, hey, ya mugs. Thinkin\\' ain\\'t drinkin\\'!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Why did I ever have kids? I could have written symphonies, or been Shakespeare. (MOANS)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Here, Homer. Have a big frosty mug of Fuhgetaboutit.\\nMan: (TOUGH GUY) I wouldn\\'t drink that. From the looks of this place, it might kill you.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SARCASTIC) Oh, who are you, the health inspector?\\nMan: Yes!\\nHealth_Inspector: (DISGUSTED) My God, look at this filth. I oughta close this dump down for good!\\nHealth_Inspector: (SUDDENLY SMILING) But then where would I go to get away from my wife! C\\'mere, Moe, you beautiful, hideous troll!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (LAUGHING) Guys, this is Frankie from the Health Department. We go way back. Lenny, you don\\'t have to hide that rat.\\nLenny_Leonard: Off you go, little fella.\\nMoe_Szyslak: When we were kids, our dads used to get drunk and make us fight each other.\\nHealth_Inspector: My Pop would buy me a malted for every tooth of Moe\\'s I knocked out.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That time you blinded me, he gave you a bike. (FONDLY) That sure was a good soundin\\' bike...\\nHealth_Inspector: Well, now to give this place a \"thorough inspection.\" (WINKS)\\nHealth_Inspector: Free from infestation, check... Sanitary utensils...\\nHealth_Inspector: Check. Food hygienically stored -- only one way to find out.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (STUNNED) Oh my God, he\\'s dead.\\nChief_Wiggum: Okay, which one of you guys parked in front of the hydrant?\\nChief_Wiggum: (SCARED) Uh, look, I didn\\'t see nothin\\' here, okay? (UNEASY CHUCKLE) Just a bunch of innocent guys, sitting around, none of them dead. Buy yourselves a nice dinner.\\nNew_Health_Inspector: (DISAPPROVING) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... (BIG EXHALE)\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, uh, Mr. New Guy. Whaddya think? Is everything... hunky dory there?\\nNew_Health_Inspector: Mr. Szyslak, your tavern is rife with Health Code violations.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (NERVOUS) You gotta be kiddin\\' me. Like what?\\nNew_Health_Inspector: For starters, the body of my predecessor is still on the floor.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh yeah. Uh well, ya see, uh trash day ain\\'t \\'til Wednesday... (AWKWARD LAUGH)\\nNew_Health_Inspector: Chicken skins in soap dispenser... cigarette butts in the air... toilet on the roof...

If anybody needs me, I\\'ll be in the john.\\nBarney_Gumble: O DANNY BOY, THE PIPES THE PIPES ARE CALLING / FROM GLEN TO GLEN AND DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE / THE SUMMER\\'S GONE AND ALL THE ROSES FALLING / \\'TIS YOU, \\'TIS YOU MUST GO, AND I MUST BIDE.\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe\\'s, a tribute. \"M\" is for Moe, the owner of Moe\\'s. \"O\" is for the \"O\" in the middle of Moe\\'s. \"E\" is for acceptance. The feeling I always got here at Moe\\'s. (BREAKING DOWN) Oh Moe, don\\'t let \\'em close you down!\\nMoe_Szyslak: It\\'s too late -- I don\\'t got the cash to clean up the bar. From now on, you guys are gonna hafta do your drinking across the street.\\nCarl_Carlson: (SHRUGS) Hey, a beer\\'s a beer.\\nHomer_Simpson: I can\\'t go to a gay bar, I\\'m too fat! Moe, I\\'m gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes.\\nHomer_Simpson: (CRESTFALLEN) ... Marge?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Thanks, Homer. No one\\'s ever trusted me before -- except for that one guy who shouldn\\'t have.\\nHomer_Simpson: That was me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh yeah.\\nMarge_Simpson: Until you pay us back, you\\'re answering to me! And there\\'s gonna be big changes.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Whoa, whoa, whoa, now wait just a minute. One thing Moe Szyslak has never had is a partner. Nor a wife, a friend, a chum, a casual acquaintance, a pen pal, a parrot, a meaningful conversation, a brief hug or eye contact.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m just going to call the suicide hotline now. (DIALS) And they\\'ve blocked my number! Oh God! (SOBS)\\nHomer_Simpson: Boy, I can\\'t wait to get my lips around an ice cold...\\nMarge_Simpson: I\\'m here protecting our investment. I\\'d like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.\\nHomer_Simpson: But I don\\'t wanna take care of the kids... (GETTING IDEA, THEN PLAYING DUMB) Um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? Bart sleeps in the microwave, right?\\nMarge_Simpson: Quit playing dumb.\\nHomer_Simpson: How many magic beans should I sell the baby for? Three? (STUPIDLY) Duh, der, duh. That\\'s me, jerk-ass Homer. Duh, der, doy.\\nMarge_Simpson: Come on, go home.\\nMarge_Simpson: Maybe some cheerier paint would make this place less of a (AIR QUOTES) \"dive.\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: Marge, my customers don\\'t like themselves.

I don\\'t know nothin\\' about how I do anything.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I had to get Edna out of Springfield -- make a fresh start in a new town, far away. A place where we can play bridge with our neighbors. And if they\\'re interested in wife-swapping, who am I to say no? I\\'m just the new guy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: But where would I get the money to start a new life? And then, opportunity strolled right in the door...\\nSnake_Jailbird: Yes, hello. I need directions to the Springfield Natural History Museum.

I\\'ll just spend the night in that motel across the street.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Love had handed me an awful dilemma. Should I rob this guy or rob him and kill him?\\nMoe_Szyslak: If I couldn\\'t spend the treasure on Edner, I didn\\'t want to spend it. I just sat there playin\\' our song on the jukebox. One gold--\\nC._Montgomery_Burns: (READING) \"...coin at a time.\"\\nC._Montgomery_Burns: Oh, you poor man.

Am I right?\\n\\n\\nLouie: This guy in here owes us money.\\nHomer_Simpson: (OMINOUS) Leave him to me.\\nHomer_Simpson: (WHINY) Ow! I hurt my fist and my palm.

He wrote \"The Right Stuff\" and \"Bonfire of the Vanities\". And coined the phrase \"radical chic!\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: Wait, wait, wait -- then that guy wasn\\'t squeezin\\' my \\'roids when he invited me to the Wordloaf Festival in Vermont?\\nLisa_Simpson: (THRILLED) The Wordloaf Festival?!

In your mouth it sounds like dirt!\\nLenny_Leonard: Homer, it\\'s just a book.\\nHomer_Simpson: (UPSET) No man should outlive his fictional wizard! No man! (SOBS)\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'sa matter, Homer? Do you still miss the UPN?\\nHomer_Simpson: (GRUMPY) Yeah, but there\\'s something else. There\\'s this loser staying in our house. Marge says she\\'s gonna kick him out, but then she never does.\\nCarl_Carlson: Well, you can\\'t kick him out, \\'cause then Marge will never learn to assert herself.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, I guess I\\'ll have to wait for Marge to show some backbone and-- (NOTICES SOMETHING) You again?!\\nHomer_Simpson: What the hell is this thing?\\n\\n\\nCarl_Carlson: What is it, Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: I just had this awful feeling that uh, Homer\\'s in terrible trouble.\\nLenny_Leonard: Oh, that\\'s funny.

Did a cop give ya a ticket for talkin\\' like a fruit?\\nDeclan_Desmond: It\\'s the oddest thing: I actually feel affection for these knuckle-dragging sub-monkeys. I feel sorry for Homer Simpson.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INCREDULOUS) Whaddaya been sippin\\' cuckoo juice? Homer\\'s got it made. He\\'s married to one hell of a woman. All I\\'ve got is this porn channel I\\'m too cheap to de-scramble.\\nDeclan_Desmond: (SCRUTINIZING) That\\'s an ad for shoe inserts.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What the?! I\\'ve been writin\\' creepy letters to that?!\\nDeclan_Desmond: But what you said about Homer it\\'s... it\\'s given me a brilliant idea!\\nMoe_Szyslak: An action movie where I play the Pope who kills the President?\\nDeclan_Desmond: No, that\\'s a terrible idea.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (QUICKLY) Yeah, I know, it is stupid. I think it could work, though. I even got a title: \"Pontiff No Return\". I came up with it, but I don\\'t really get it.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOANS) How could my Dad go out with Selma? Don\\'t those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well gee, Homer, you uh, ain\\'t exactly open-casket material yourself.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SOBS) Words hurt, you know.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, you gotta be kiddin\\' me.\\nHomer_Simpson: Listen to \\'em. They\\'re on top of the world while I\\'m sittin\\' here pretending I have a stool.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SOUR) All because of a bunch of stuff that happened.\\nLenny_Leonard: Homer, don\\'t be so quick to abandon this paparazzo thing.\\nCarl_Carlson: Yeah, it\\'s an American tradition to cut people down to size because they\\'ve brought so much joy into our lives.\\nLenny_Leonard: You know who I can\\'t stand? That Robin Williams. Y\\'know one time I saw him eating dinner with his children, he wouldn\\'t take the time out to do all the funny bits from his movies.\\nCarl_Carlson: And my sister once saw Burt Reynolds at an airport, and he wouldn\\'t even co-sign her mortgage.\\nHomer_Simpson: You guys are right -- I should get back in the game. (MOANS) But I threw away my camera.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh here, use this one.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I was gonna use it to take secret photos in the ladies\\' turlet.

(POINTS TO BART) And you could win your Mom back by appealing to her feelings.\\nBart_Simpson: Gee Moe, you give great advice.\\nHomer_Simpson: (JOKING) Yeah. What have you done with the real Moe?\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ya know, I think I\\'ll volunteer, too.\\nBarney_Gumble: Why did you say \"too?\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, I assume I\\'m not the first one.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (AS DENTIST) Okay, this might hurt a little.

Or is it?\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah, it\\'s paint.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh. Then I\\'ll have to charge you extra, depending on the color. Uh, stick out your tongue.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (HOLDING UP STRIPS) Eggshell? No. Malabar ivory? No. Mediterranean ecru? No. Ah, here it is -- white.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ooh, that\\'s gonna cost ya.\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'ve got tow dough I\\'m lookin\\' to blow, Moe!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Huh?\\nHomer_Simpson: (EXPLAINING) I\\'m buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Four \"Lobster-politans\" comin\\' up!\\nCarl_Carlson: Here\\'s to Homer and the cars he towed!\\nLenny_Leonard: With those jerks out of the way, I was able to park right outside!\\nHomer_Simpson: (SMELLING BLOOD) Outside? That\\'s a one-hour parking zone -- and you\\'ve been here a good eighty-one minutes.\\nLenny_Leonard: Correction -- a great eighty-one minutes! \\'Cause nothin\\' beats hangin\\' around with old friends, drinkin\\' lobster-based designer drinks and--\\nLenny_Leonard: Good joke, Homer! (NERVOUS LAUGHTER) You can unhook my car now.\\nCarl_Carlson: Uh, looks like he\\'s driving away with it.\\nLenny_Leonard: No, he\\'s just moving it so it won\\'t get towed.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Take that, you tow-talitarian!\\nCarl_Carlson: Doesn\\'t that joke make light of totalitarians?\\nLenny_Leonard: Yeah. Stalin put my grandmother in a forced labor camp for twenty years.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Look, I was insensitive and I\\'m sorry. But what this is really about is a bully with a winch.\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: If I\\'d wanted the laws of this town enforced to the letter, I wouldn\\'t have hired fatty here as police chief.\\nChief_Wiggum: (TO RALPH) Hear that, Ralphie? The mayor knows daddy!\\nAgnes_Skinner: All right, listen up. I know a thing or two about tow-Joes. I married three of \\'em, and they\\'re real territorial. Now here\\'s the plan...\\nAgnes_Skinner: Get in here, Mel. I don\\'t bite. I might gum ya. And you might like it.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe, my family\\'s gone, my dog hates me, and I can\\'t remember what happened last night. Was I here?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Was you ever. You came in sayin\\' you really needed to forget something, so I mixed you up the most powerful drink I got... (DRAMATIC) the \"Forget-Me-Shot.\"\\nHomer_Simpson: A \"Forget-Me-Shot?\" Never heard of it.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (PROUD) That means it worked. No one ever remembers. That\\'s why I made this video to explain the process.\\nMoe_Szyslak: You start with a splash of Jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, Triple-Sec, Quadruple-Sec, gunk from a dog\\'s eye, Absolut Pickle...\\nHomer_Simpson: Mmm, pickle...\\nMoe_Szyslak: The red stripe from Aquafresh...\\nMoe_Szyslak: And the funniest ingredient... the venom of the Louisiana Loboto-moth.\\nMoe_Szyslak: C\\'mon, sweetie.\\nMoe_Szyslak: You stir it with a home pregnancy test till it turns \"positive\"...\\nMoe_Szyslak: And presto: the Forget-Me-Shot.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Aw jeez, I don\\'t look like that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: The point is, this drink is the ultimate brain bleacher. (SLIGHT MENACE) One swig wipes out the last day of your life.\\nKrusty_the_Clown: (ENTERING, UPSET) Gimme one of those forget-me-drinks -- I made a mistake I gotta wipe out! I was trying to do a Don Rickles about Arabs, but it turned into a Mel Gibson about Mexicans.\\nKrusty_the_Clown: What the hell am I doin\\' here? I gotta get back to the Latin Grammys.\\nHispanic_Crowd: There he is! / Get him! / (ANGRY JEERS) Hot sauce his eyes!\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh my God, why would I wanna wipe out my memory? What horrible thing did I do?\\nChief_Wiggum: You don\\'t remember, huh?\\nChief_Wiggum: (STERNLY) There was a domestic disturbance at your address yesterday.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SHOCKED REMEMBERING NOISE) Chief Wiggum! I remember seeing you...\\nHomer_Simpson: Marge had a black eye?! I could never do something like that! (WORRIED) Could I?\\nChief_Wiggum: Why don\\'t you ask the person who filed the complaint? Not that I am authorized to release that infor--\\nHomer_Simpson: Flanders!\\nChief_Wiggum: (PISSED) Fine, it was Flanders. Now since you know everything, who was Jack the Ripper?\\nHomer_Simpson: (RUNNING OUT, DOPPLER) The queen\\'s private surgeonnn!\\nChief_Wiggum: (STUNNED) Wow.\\nHomer_Simpson: Marge put so much work into that party. The least I could do is be surprised. If only I could forget what happened today.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I got just the drink to wipe your mind clean... the \"Forget-Me-Shot.\" (TO LENNY AND CARL) Fellas, if you got anything that you want to say to Homer that he\\'ll never remember, say it now.\\nLenny_Leonard: (QUICKLY) Blue pants make you look fat.\\nCarl_Carlson: (PILING ON) I\\'ve never learned your kids\\' names.\\nLenny_Leonard: Your yard is unkempt.\\nCarl_Carlson: It is obvious you\\'re bald.\\nLenny_Leonard: Your thighs make noise.\\nCarl_Carlson: I find your small hands attractive.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'ve spit in every drink I ever served you. (SPITS IN HOMER\\'S DRINK) Bottoms up!\\nHomer_Simpson: Hmmm... The only problem is, I\\'m sure to retain some image of coming home and finding Duffman.

Ten bucks.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Knock yourself out.\\nHomer_Simpson: Is everyone here as sick of those stupid politicians as I am?\\nSeymour_Skinner: What about the media? They\\'re not covering the issues, they just want to declare a frontrunner and go back to their mansions.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Who wants to abolish democracy forever? Show of hands.\\nCarl_Carlson: I could really go for some kinda military dictator, like Juan Perón. When he disappeared ya, you stayed disappeared.\\nLenny_Leonard: Plus his wife was Madonna.\\nNed_Flanders: What\\'re we gonna do? We can\\'t not vote. Nobody does that!\\nHomer_Simpson: (GETTING IDEA) Why don\\'t we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: You mean Dennis Kucinich?\\nDennis_Kucinich: (TWERPY KID VOICE) Hey!\\nDennis_Kucinich: I\\'m right here.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: Sorry.\\nHomer_Simpson: No, no.

(BITTER) unlike me. You have all your hair... (BITTER) unlike me. No kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... (SOBS) Oh, God, I hate my life! (SOBS)\\nSeymour_Skinner: (ENCOURAGED) Gee. Compared to you, my life is one big half-day!\\nHomer_Simpson: (ENCOURAGING) Exactly. You\\'re good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn\\'t consider you an option?\\nSeymour_Skinner: Thanks, Homer. I don\\'t think the school pep squad could\\'ve cheered me up more. And they were state runners up in nineteen ninety-seven!\\nCarl_Carlson: Homer, that was amazing -- he actually felt better comin\\' outta the break-up than he did goin\\' in.\\nLenny_Leonard: Say Homer, you\\'re real good at this. Think you could dump my girlfriend Doreen for me?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Doreen? She\\'s cheated on you with everyone -- well, except for me. And I\\'ve showered her with gifts! Fancy soaps and massage oils and uh... what have ya...\\nLenny_Leonard: (LOOKS OUT WINDOW) Ooh, here she comes -- work your magic, Homer!\\nDoreen: Is Lenny here?\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, I\\'m afraid Lenny\\'s dead.\\nDoreen: (QUIET SHOCK) What? I just talked to him.\\nHomer_Simpson: And you will again. Because he isn\\'t really dead. And now this next piece of news won\\'t seem so bad...\\nHomer_Simpson: Lisa\\'s mad at me, and now she\\'s using Marge\\'s maiden name instead of mine.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer, whatever you done to that little girl, you just gotta do something even nicer to win her back.\\nCarl_Carlson: She may never take back your name, but there\\'s still a chance she\\'ll take you back as a Daddy.\\nHomer_Simpson: (TOUCHED) Wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So the name \"Lisa Simpson\" is available, huh? (CONSIDERING) Lotta goodwill attached to that name... (NODS) I\\'m gonna take it.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Lisa\\'s Tavern, Lisa speaking.\\n\\n\\nLenny_Leonard: (POINTED) Hey Carl, got any idea what direction Mecca\\'s in?\\nCarl_Carlson: Why don\\'tcha ask Homer? He oughtta know, by dint of his son\\'s new friend.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, Bashir\\'s great. If Derek Jeter married Mariah Carey, it wouldn\\'t last, but I bet they\\'d have a kid like him.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer, this is serious. This Bashir kid is Muslim, and therefore up to something.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, I can\\'t believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view.\\nFbi_Agent: For the last time, Fayed, where did you hide the nerve gas!\\nArab_Man: Under your Statue Of Liberty\\'s dress!\\nArab_Man: And she loved it!\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh my God. What can I do?\\nCarl_Carlson: Well, if you want to stop Bashir and his war on American principles, you could discriminate against his family, in employment and housing.\\nLenny_Leonard: That\\'s pretty patriotic, but I got a better idea -- invite \\'em over.\\nMoe_Szyslak: A little dinner, a little dessert, then you Jack Bauer \\'em into giving you all their secrets.\\nHomer_Simpson: (GRIMLY) I guess I have no choice.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s wrong with your bees, Lisa?\\nLisa_Simpson: (BITTER) Mr. Burns took away their sanctuary, and now they aren\\'t strong enough to survive on their own.\\nLisa_Simpson: I\\'m going home. Give me the keys to my bike lock.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Are you sure?\\nLisa_Simpson: (TIPSY) Give me the keys!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, okay! (HANDS HER THE KEYS) Don\\'t know why I had \\'em in the first place.\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOANS) I\\'d do anything to cheer up my little girl.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Really?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Listen Homer, in the back room I got these super-tough Africanized bees. I saw this ad in a gentleman\\'s magazine for excited African honeys, and that\\'s what they sent me. If we could combine them with Lisa\\'s bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment.\\nHomer_Simpson: Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (GETS IDEA) Actually Homer...\\nHomer_Simpson: (EYES WIDE, GASPS) You and me?\\nMoe_Szyslak: No, the bees!\\nHomer_Simpson: (PROTESTING TOO MUCH) Oh yeah, yeah, that\\'s what I meant too. I have no... inclination...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Got the queen?\\nHomer_Simpson: Yep.\\nHomer_Simpson: And she\\'s ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners. (CHUCKLES)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Now, let\\'s give them some privacy while they... get down to buzziness. (SLIGHT CHUCKLE)\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SNIFFLES, THEN, IMPATIENT) If they was me they\\'d be done by now.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, Homer, you wanna try my new Vance Connor-politan? Like Vance, it is smooth, cool and oh-so-sophisticated.\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'ll just stick with my beer.\\nLenny_Leonard: Homer, why are you so down on Vance Connor? He gave me one of his kidneys.\\nCarl_Carlson: Yeah, me too.\\nHomer_Simpson: Because when Vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life.\\nHomer_Simpson: Why did you just exchange that look of guilt?\\nCarl_Carlson: (SIGHS) Lenny, uh, I think it\\'s time for us to come clean.\\nLenny_Leonard: About how we give each other haircuts?\\nCarl_Carlson: No, we\\'ll take that secret to our graves. I\\'m talkin\\' about uh (SHOOTS LENNY MEANINGFUL LOOK), you know...\\nLenny_Leonard: Oh, right! Listen, Homer, somethin\\' weird happened back in high school...\\nHomer_Simpson: (INTRIGUED) So there\\'s a chance I actually won! I\\'ve got to dig up that ballot box!\\nAl_Gore: Just let it go, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: Al Gore?\\nAl_Gore: Homer, I had a presidential election stolen from me. But I moved on, and I think you could say everything worked out all right.\\nAl_Gore: (TO NOBEL PRIZE) Isn\\'t that right, Alfred? (HOLDING UP NOBEL PRIZE, SPEAKING IN A FALSETTO, AS ALFRED NOBEL) It sure is, Albert.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: People like Flanders make me sick. If I was Marge\\'s landlord I\\'d fix her pipes and I\\'d shower her with flowers and-and take her on a romantic getaway to the South Seas and I... I\\'d never return.\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah, you\\'d treat her right.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, here\\'s how you get back at Flanders: you go to the media and get them to expose what a horrible person he really is.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, right -- like \"Dateline\" did to you!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, three times. (UPBEAT) The last one was nominated for a Peabody, whatever that is.\\nKent_Brockman: This is Kent Brockman with a Channel 6 exclusive: The Evil Ned.\\nKent_Brockman: Seven forty-two Evergreen Terrace. A tiny slice of suburban heaven. But like dating an actress, what seemed like heaven soon turned to hell.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Now, you learn your numbers from these billiard balls while Daddy gets happier and happier and then sadder and sadder.\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe, what are you doing?\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m spiffin\\' up the place! Jeez, can\\'t a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin\\' polite inquiries?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Huh. I got a window here.\\nHomer_Simpson: (REALIZING) Hey, Maggie could play out there... while I watch her from in here. (TURNS) Whaddaya say, Maggie?\\nHomer_Simpson: (TOUCHED) Aw, her first enabling.\\nLenny_Leonard: (CALLING) Hi, Maggie! / Up here, beautiful! / Yo, Mags!\\nBarney_Gumble: (PLAYFUL) It\\'s me! Uncle Barney! Remember I taught you your ABCs. (SINGS) A-B- (FORGETS NEXT LETTER) P-K...

(REGRETFUL) I-I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t mean that. What\\'s the correct term?\\nMaya: Little person.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (PLEASED) Whoa! Look at me bein\\' polite!\\nMaya: So, aren\\'t you gonna invite me in?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh of course, of course. Um, I-I just have to -- I have to tidy up the place! Just one second. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)\\nMoe_Szyslak: So Maya. Um, you always been this size, or is this like a Benjamin Button deal? (UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH) No, I mean is, I just...your picture just made you look more... life-sized.\\nMaya: That was taken at Legoland. I was afraid you\\'d be disappointed in the real me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Are you kiddin\\' me? You\\'re the best thing to come into this bar since cable TV. And unlike cable TV, I ain\\'t stealin\\' you from the Chinese restaurant across the street there.\\nChinese_Restaurateur: I see you watch ESPN Two! I know!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, that\\'s great there, Ling Chow.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, uh, you still want to go out?\\nMaya: (SHRUGS) That\\'s why I\\'m here.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Great. Let me get a car seat.\\nMaya: (NOT SURE WHETHER TO BE OFFENDED) Car seat?\\nMoe_Szyslak: I took out the passenger seat to save gas. But I\\'m gonna use it now. \\'Cause we\\'re gonna do the town!\\nCarl_Carlson: (PLAYFUL) How\\'d your date go, Moe?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Incredible. I\\'ve never felt like this before. It\\'s like my heart wants to do her.\\nBarflies: Awww.\\nLenny_Leonard: So, when are we gonna meet her?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (UNEASY) Oh, I can\\'t wait till you guys get to uh...\\nThought_Bubble_Lenny: Yep, that\\'s what we\\'d do!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Let me ask you guys somethin\\': how would you treat a person who\\'s generally dynamite but uh, in some way... a little different?\\nLenny_Leonard: You mean like how we treat Homer?\\nCarl_Carlson: \\'Cause he can\\'t remember limericks?\\nHomer_Simpson: I can too! \"There once was this guy from an island off the coast of Massachusetts... uh, Nantucket, I think it was. Anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh...\\nCarl_Carlson: Look at him struggling with the simplest rhyme.\\nLenny_Leonard: It\\'s a-a-b-b-a, dumbass!\\nHomer_Simpson: There you are!\\nHomer_Simpson: Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. (TO BULLY BABIES) Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Guys, after all the years I\\'ve given you advice, now I need a little advice from you.\\nCarl_Carlson: We never follow your advice.\\nLenny_Leonard: The one time I did, I went to jail for three years.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (DEFENSIVE) You made some good friends, didn\\'t ya?\\nLenny_Leonard: Just \\'cause you\\'re chained to a guy don\\'t make him your friend.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Tomato, tomahto. Now how am I gonna win Maya back?\\nLenny_Leonard: Well, if I\\'ve learned anything from romantic comedies, is that you\\'ve got to make a grand, reckless gesture, the kind that looks like it might blow up in your face.\\nMoe_Szyslak: But what if it blows up in my face?\\nCarl_Carlson: With your face, who cares?\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s the matter, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: Not a thing in the world.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, I wish I could say the same.\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe, this was a great thing for you. You went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. And sometime when you least expect it, you\\'ll realize that someone loved you. And that means someone can love you again. And that\\'ll make you smile.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey! Homer was right.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Who\\'da thought such a little woman could make me feel so big?\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (LOUD WHISPER) Let\\'s try what chapter seven calls \"Un-sults\" -- insults disguised as compliments. (NORMAL VOICE) Hey, Lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you\\'re not in the circus.\\nLenny_Leonard: Well that\\'s very nice of you-- (REALIZING) Hey! You sayin\\' my clothes are clown-like? Oh God, I feel so insecure! Please be my friend...\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO LISA) See, it works. And un-sults are just the beginning. There\\'s also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... (STAGY) Hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?\\nMoe_Szyslak: I do! / Yeah! / You know it! / Oh boy!\\nHomer_Simpson: Ooo, I\\'m sorry, Moe. I didn\\'t mean everyone everyone. Hope you don\\'t mind.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No, oh sure, no, uh no... that\\'s all right.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SOBS LIKE TEENAGE GIRL, THEN CLEARLY SAYS) If I didn\\'t sell booze, they probably wouldn\\'t even come here.

You think just \\'cause I\\'m black I know all other black people?\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, I... uh...\\nCarl_Carlson: Actually, Drederick and I are very good friends.

I\\'m a head hunter.\\nGator: (PATIENT CHUCKLE) I\\'m a corporate recruiter who specializes in nuclear workers.\\nHomer_Simpson: I guess these days headhunters can be anything.\\nHomer_Simpson: You nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. Times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin\\'.\\nLenny_Leonard: (THOUGHTFUL) Are these business cards? Or passports to a better future?\\nGator: Business cards.\\nLenny_Leonard: (IMPRESSED) Nice.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Mr. Smithers, our lives are awesome, thanks to you. And because I know you \"like your loafers light,\" I want to give something back.\\nHomer_Simpson: Use that image any way you want.\\nCarl_Carlson: Three cheers for Mr. Smithers!\\nCarl_Carlson: To Mr. Smithers! / Hooray!\\nHomer_Simpson: Uh listen... can I leave a little early tomorrow? My kid has a thing.\\nCarl_Carlson: Ooo yeah, can I leave early too? I wanna take a nap so I\\'m awake for the meteor shower.\\nWaylon_Smithers: Well... I\\'m flexible. Go ahead.\\nLenny_Leonard: Y\\'know, I used to think you was just as bad as Mr. Burns, now I think you\\'re just as good as me.\\nCarl_Carlson: (SOTTO) Oh, that is a huge compliment.\\nWaylon_Smithers: Uh, excuse me.\\nWaylon_Smithers: Yes, the service on my car was excellent. (BEAT) Five out of five. Four out of five. Five out of five. Um, excuse me, can I go back and change that four out of five to five out of five? I\\'m wasting your time?\\nHomer_Simpson: Smithers. What a marshmallow.\\nHomer_Simpson: I don\\'t have a thing with my kid tomorrow!\\nCarl_Carlson: You told me you did.\\nHomer_Simpson: I do, but I\\'m not going to it.\\nCarl_Carlson: To Smithers, the world\\'s dumbest loser!\\nLenny_Leonard: There\\'s nothing sweeter than being nice to a guy\\'s face and then stabbin\\' him in the back the minute he walks away!\\nWaylon_Smithers: All right, that\\'s it.\\nWaylon_Smithers: You know, I used to wonder why Mr. Burns hated humanity. Now I know. You open your heart and they mock your very decency!\\nHomer_Simpson: (EXTREMELY MOCKING) Ooh! We mock your very decency.\\nLenny_Leonard: It\\'s official. Smithers is now worse than Mr. Burns.\\nLenny_Leonard: Instead of releasing hounds, he releases wolverines!\\nHomer_Simpson: I never thought I\\'d say this, but I wish Mr. Burns was back.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, if wishes were horses I\\'d be eatin\\' wish-meat every night.\\nLenny_Leonard: What does that mean?\\nMoe_Szyslak: It means it\\'s not like you\\'re gonna break into the prison and bust him out or anything.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Aw hey, c\\'mon. You can\\'t really be serious about breaking him out.\\nLenny_Leonard: It\\'s too late to turn back, Moe. We\\'ve exchanged meaningful looks.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No, you can still turn back! The point of no return is the whispered huddle.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh God, oh God!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer.\\nLenny_Leonard: Homer, where you been the last few weeks?\\nHomer_Simpson: (BITTERLY) Playing nursemaid to Chief Wiggum.\\nCarl_Carlson: People who get shot in the chest are such big babies. (SIPS BEER)\\nChief_Wiggum: Well, well, well. So this is the \"Saint Elmo\\'s Fire\" reunion that Andrew McCarthy himself was going to attend.\\nHomer_Simpson: Okay, maybe I lied. But you\\'ve been so needy... \"I\\'m hungry,\" \"I\\'m itchy,\" \"that\\'s not my blood type...\"\\nChief_Wiggum: Yeah, yeah, yeah... whoa... what have we here?\\nChief_Wiggum: (READING) \"World\\'s worst friend.\"\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey man, you planted that!\\nChief_Wiggum: It\\'s your word against the Chief of Police. Take him away, boys.\\nLou: Chief, being a bad friend isn\\'t against the law.\\nChief_Wiggum: Well if it was, he\\'d be gettin\\' the chair! You, you all would!\\nChief_Wiggum: Bad friend! Bad friend! Bad friend! (SOBS)\\n\\n\\nDuffman: Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Duffman is here to refill your beers!\\nBarney_Gumble: Okay.\\nBarney_Gumble: Thank you!\\nDuffman: Now, for the only thing better than Duff...\\nBarflies: (CONFUSED NOISE) Better than Duff?

And everyone\\'s got problems -- especially the married ones.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: May we use your restroom to change our kids out of their cricket uniforms?\\nManjula_Nahasapeemapetilon: We got caught in the rain because someone wouldn\\'t use international short form rules.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Calm down there, \\'Pu and She-Pu. You can use the restroom.\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: (SIGHS) My one day off and it\\'s miserable.\\nManjula_Nahasapeemapetilon: This is my day everyday!\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: You see this? (MIMES PLAYING TINY SITAR) I\\'m playing the world\\'s smallest sitar for you.\\nManjula_Nahasapeemapetilon: Oh, thank you for saving my precious...Gheet! (SIGHS)\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SYMPATHETIC) Sounds like you had a rough day.\\nManjula_Nahasapeemapetilon: It\\'s true.\\nManjula_Nahasapeemapetilon: My eyes have more bags than the Darjeeling Limited.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SLIGHTLY CONFUSED CHUCKLE) Yeah, that\\'s probably a good one. Here, I got somethin\\' that might cheer ya up.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I got this for women that came to the bar, and Low-Blow Boxing for the guys.\\nBoxer: (PRE-RECORDED, IN PAIN) My nards! My nards! My nards!\\nMoe_Szyslak: So uh, would you like to cut one? (THEN NERVOUS) I mean a rug. Oh God, I always say the wrong thing.\\nMarge_Simpson: (ANNOYED) You said you\\'d be home by seven to help with my mother\\'s birthday!\\nApu_Nahasapeemapetilon: (PANICKED) Then what happened?\\nHomer_Simpson: I don\\'t know.\\nCarny: Teacup?

How innocuous are your flashbacks?\\nRev._Timothy_Lovejoy: Well... I... uh...\\nHomer_Simpson: (GRIM) The ferry will be back in ten minutes.

I was wondering if you would judge an outrageous beard contest I\\'m in tonight.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, anyone can get a laugh at the expense of an ugly dog. But crazy beards? That\\'s where the big boys play.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Can you make it sound like girls askin\\' me?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (DELIGHTED CHUCKLE) Okay, you crazy dames. I\\'ll do it!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Which means this joint is closed for the night.\\nBarney_Gumble: Don\\'t be that way.\\nHomer_Simpson: You can\\'t close!

The president says Iran has gotten hold of the most dangerous weapon known to man: the B.P. Oil rig. That\\'s right, ladies and gentlemen. I know how to make that leak disappear -- put it on NBC.\\n\\n\\nLisa_Simpson: Hey, Dad.\\nHomer_Simpson: (TIPSY) Hey pal, howya doin\\'?\\nLisa_Simpson: Fine. I was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: The only thing I know about strategy is that whatever the manager does, it\\'s wrong, unless it works, in which case he\\'s a button-pusher.\\nLenny_Leonard: I hate guys that just push buttons all day.\\nCarl_Carlson: You just push buttons all day.\\nLenny_Leonard: You know, ever since Obama came in, you\\'ve got all the answers, don\\'t you?\\nLisa_Simpson: (FRUSTRATED NOISE) Does anyone here actually know anything about baseball?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (NODS) Uh, the guys in that booth down there.\\nGary: As a pitcher, Cliff Lee is clearly superior to Zack (GRENKY) Grienke.\\nProfessor_Jonathan_Frink: Uh yes, I completely agree, with the following colossal exception: before the fourth inning after a road loss in a domed stadium. Then it\\'s good to be Grienke. Unless he\\'s got a bunion, in which case he is notably ineffective. (FRINK NOISE)\\nLisa_Simpson: Wow, I\\'m surprised you guys know so much about a sport.\\nProfessor_Jonathan_Frink: (PORTENTOUS) Oh Lisa, baseball is a game played by the dexterous but only understood by the Poin-dexterous. (CHUCKLE) Do you understand what I laid out there?\\nDoug: The key to understanding the game is sabermetrics.\\nLisa_Simpson: Huh?\\nProfessor_Jonathan_Frink: The field was developed by statistician Bill James...\\nBill_James: I made baseball as fun as doing your taxes!\\nProfessor_Jonathan_Frink: Using sabermetrics, even an eight-year-old girl can run a ballclub with the sagacity of a Stengel and the single-mindedness of a Steinbrenner. I call it a Stein-stengel-(FRINK NOISE).\\nLisa_Simpson: Thanks, guys.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (ANNOYED) Hey, speaking of stats, I\\'m none too pleased about your ratio of \"seats occupied\" to \"beers ordered.\"\\nGary: You mean our SOBO? Let\\'s calculate it now!\\nDoug: What\\'s the conversion factor for ginger beer?\\nGary: (\"DUH\") Refreshingness over effervescence.\\nBenjamin: Plus or minus tang.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (RUEFUL) Why did I advertise my drink specials in Scientific American?\\nProfessor_Jonathan_Frink: I can think of three reasons. First of all you...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Shut up.\\n\\n\\nLenny_Leonard: Wow, Homer, this year\\'s only eleven hours old and it\\'s already your annus horribilis. (OFF THE OTHERS\\' LOOKS) My New Year\\'s Resolution was to learn Latin.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (CONSPIRATORIAL) Uh listen, Homer -- I know a guy who fixes things for folks who need things fixed. But, uh, I can\\'t talk about it here.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, still not private enough.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, this is private, but a little dank.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer, what you do is go down to window nine at the courthouse. You slip the guy a hundred bucks and your record is as clean as... (LOOKS AROUND BAR) uh, I ain\\'t got nothin\\' clean to compare it to.\\nMoe_Szyslak: It was either this or put in a ladies room.\\nFat_Tony: Exquisite. As a reward, I\\'ve planned a little surprise for you.\\n\\n\\nWaylon_Smithers: Can I have a scotch and water?\\nMoe_Szyslak: My scotch is a scotch and water.\\nWaylon_Smithers: Business is slow, huh?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah. Frankly, I\\'m surprised you\\'re not across the street where they drink for fun, instead of here, where, uh, horrible addiction compels you.\\nWaylon_Smithers: They won\\'t let me in -- no one wants an executive assistant who only works out six hours a day. If only this town had a \"men\\'s bar\" for the average-looking fellow...\\nMr._Burns_Heads: (FIRST HEAD) ...True admiration... (SECOND HEAD) Self-made man... (THIRD HEAD) kill the other two heads... (FIRST HEAD) true admiration... (SECOND HEAD) self-made man... (THIRD HEAD) kill them before they suspect... (FIRST HEAD) suspect what?...\\nWaylon_Smithers: Huh? Huh? Listen, what if I helped you turn this bar into a hangout for guys like me?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTRIGUED) Uh-huh...\\nWaylon_Smithers: Just so it\\'s clear what I\\'m proposing, the men I\\'m talking about are...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Whoa, whoa, whoa! No offense, uh, but uh, I just ain\\'t comfortable hanging around all night with, uh, y\\'know whatchamacallit... uh, swishkabobs.\\nWaylon_Smithers: (KNOWING) Yeah, right. It\\'s too bad. Could have been fun. Could have made a little money.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Thank you, but I am very happy with my clientele as they are.\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey, Moe! Two more for me and my buddy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That was my grandmother\\'s wedding urinal! That\\'s it. We are changing this place up.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Whoa, check that out! / Stuff is getting\\' done! / Look at them renovations! / And... finished!\\nMoe_Szyslak: After this, ain\\'t no turning back.\\n\\n\\nLenny_Leonard: You know, I love our Valentine\\'s Day tradition of going out with each others\\' sisters.\\nCarl_Carlson: Is there anything better than my best friend\\'s face on a girl body?\\nLainie: Not that I can think of!\\nCarlotta: Nothin\\' better!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Boy, I love Valentine\\'s Day. Stir a drop of Jägermeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry Chapstick, call it \"Cupid\\'s Ambrosia,\" and you can charge up the wazoo.\\nHomer_Simpson: (CHUCKLES) Now all you need are customers. (DRAINS THE DRINK) Well, better get home to the little woman. (CHUCKLES)\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO MOE, SLIGHTLY CONCERNED) Do you have plans for tonight?\\nMoe_Szyslak: What are you, crazy? Of course I do. I got a hot date. C\\'mon, scram, so I can get ready!\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m tellin\\' ya, I\\'m fine. I\\'ve never been happier. See?\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'s a smile, right? Showin\\' teeth, eyes all crinkly.

Spending Valentine\\'s Day by yourself?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (BIG) Huhza?\\nDr._Kissingher: If you\\'re watching this alone, your love life is like \"Sister Act 3\": no Whoopi!\\nMoe_Szyslak: I knew my love life was like that movie somehow.\\nDr._Kissingher: Well, I\\'m going to tell you my secrets right now...\\nDr._Kissingher: If \"right now\" means \"tomorrow night at my seminar at the Springfield Airport Motor Lodge.\" So if you\\'re ready to turn from couch potato to sex tornado, come and see me, Dr. Kissingher.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, what have I got to lose? They say for every man, somewhere on Earth there\\'s one woman.\\n\\n\\nGrampa_Simpson: (BITTERLY) Everything everyone just said is either obvious or wrong!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer, do somethin\\' about your dad. He\\'s casting a pall over this grim dungeon full of losers.\\nLenny_Leonard: Pfft, dungeon. We can leave any time we want.\\nCarl_Carlson: Homer, why don\\'t you just make some more of the serum yourself?\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, because Lisa won\\'t tell me what flower it\\'s from.\\nVoice: Excuse me...\\nWalther_Hotenhoffer: My name is Walther Hotenhoffer and I\\'m in the pharmaceutical business.\\nCarl_Carlson: I was wonderin\\' when that guy was gonna state his name and occupation.\\nWalther_Hotenhoffer: Quiet. (TO HOMER) Sir, has your daughter found a drug that renders old people tolerable to us normals?\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah. But Lisa won\\'t tell me how to make it.\\nWalther_Hotenhoffer: Lisa is irrelevant.\\nLenny_Leonard: (STERN) You better elaborate!\\nWalther_Hotenhoffer: All I need is one drop of extract, and I can synthesize the drug at my plant. (SCRUTINIZES GRAMPA) But where do I find that drop?...\\nWalther_Hotenhoffer: Nein... nein... nein... nein... ah-ha!\\nGrampa_Simpson: Not so fast, Fritz! Before you waltz off with my Grampa grease, I wanna know, what did you do during the war?\\nWalther_Hotenhoffer: World War Two?

My home in a hollowed-out tree?\\nHomer_Simpson: (CONTENTED SIGH) Pretty sweet, eh boy?\\nBart_Simpson: Y\\'know, I was skeptical, but I guess therapy works.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: All day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and I have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh-huh.\\nKirk_Van_Houten: Well, Homer, you\\'re safe here. You can forget everything they said.\\nHomer_Simpson: When I look at you -- all I see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! Foibles! Foibles! FOIBLES!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Calm down there, Homer.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What got into him?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Freaky ad campaign they\\'re running.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah, isn\\'t this place great? If you\\'re single you can come here every night.\\nNed_Flanders: I don\\'t wanna come here. Last time I did, someone slipped me a Mickey and wrote \"CHURCHY JOE\" on my face.\\nMoe_Szyslak: It\\'s your own fault. You gotta read the coaster.\\nNed_Flanders: Oh my.\\nHomer_Simpson: Ned, let\\'s cut to the chase.\\nNed_Flanders: Yeah, let me guess. You\\'re probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein\\' Edna.\\nHomer_Simpson: Ned, if it\\'s boneheaded to talk you outta seein\\' Edna, then I don\\'t wanna be brainheaded.\\nNed_Flanders: Homer, listen to me. For a long time now I\\'ve been lookin\\' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with Marge. Then I remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine.

(WISTFUL) Someone to put in my prayers.\\nHomer_Simpson: (CHOKED UP) Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude.\\nNed_Flanders: That\\'s right. And like any man, I put on my secret Christian underpants one leg at a time.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SOBS) Oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss.\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOVED) Ned, I have a confession to make: I may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I wish you and Edna the best.\\nHomer_Simpson: Fellow barflies! To Ned Flanders and Edna Krabappel!\\nBarney_Gumble: What a fox!\\nCarl_Carlson: Yes!

I\\'m buyin\\'.\\nLenny_Leonard: Can we just have the cash value of the drink?\\nCarl_Carlson: I\\'d rather use my money to buy a Moe souvenir t-shirt.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That comes in kid sizes too.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: We\\'re not here for you, we\\'re here for Lenny.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I wouldn\\'t join one of your hare-brained schemes for all the Japanese girlfriend pillows in Kyoto!\\nLenny_Leonard: Sorry, guys. I just adopted a Capuchin monkey and I can\\'t leave it alone during the bonding phase.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (DESPERATE) Wait, wait, wait, wait, I want in! What does your crew need? A safecracker? A wheel man?\\nHomer_Simpson: The caper is writing a kids\\' fantasy novel.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SHEEPISH) Well, I don\\'t like to brag about it, but I did publish five modestly successful children\\'s books.\\nBart_Simpson: All we need now is a computer guy...\\nSeymour_Skinner: \"...and so, Lucinda placed the fifth shard in the stained-glass window, which now clearly read: \\'your parents are alive.\\' Gregor turned to his twin sister and they both understood: their journey was just beginning. The end.\"\\nBart_Simpson: It\\'s good. \"Weekly Reader Star Selection\" good.\\nHomer_Simpson: I just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is.\\nProfessor_Jonathan_Frink: Who wants to see my cover (FRINK-Y) mock-up?!\\nHomer_Simpson: (READING TITLE) \"The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy.\"\\nNeil_Gaiman: I\\'m so proud of us.\\nBart_Simpson: Oh, you didn\\'t write any of it!\\nNeil_Gaiman: (DEFENSIVE) That tuna didn\\'t salad itself!\\nHomer_Simpson: Gentlemen! To \"The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy!\"\\nHomer_Simpson: So, does this square us for Kansas City?\\nBart_Simpson: Square as \"Golden Books,\" Pop.\\nLisa_Simpson: What happened to me? In one vulnerable moment I became the thing I hated most -- a literary fraud.\\nBart_Simpson: But Lis, when this book comes out, you\\'ll be beloved! Not just by Milhouses, you\\'ll get attention from Jacksons, Xanders -- even Aidens!\\nLisa_Simpson: (DREAMY) Aww, I\\'ve always wanted an Aiden...\\nSeymour_Skinner: Here it is: an advance copy.\\nPatty_Bouvier: \"The Vampire Twins Of Transylvania Prep?!\" Where\\'s the trolls?\\nProfessor_Jonathan_Frink: The trolls are now vampires, the Brooklyn Bridge is now a castle, and Fuzzlepitch is now Bloodball! Oh! Weak! Weak! And lame!\\nHomer_Simpson: How could the publishers change our book? If they had been in charge of the Sistine Chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope\\'s private naked dude mural!\\n\\n\\nKrusty_the_Clown: (HEMS AND HAWS) When you said... (NERVOUS LAUGH)\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m payin\\' extra for this channel? Hasn\\'t been good since \"The Wire.\" Aw, who am I kiddin\\'? I never watched \"The Wire.\" Had to bluff my way through so many conversations.\\nKrusty_the_Clown: Well, Annie, I think you know my answer.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah. I keep meaning to switch things around, but this place is always a crime scene.\\nLenny: (CARL VOICE) I\\'m Carl.\\nCarl: (LENNY VOICE) Don\\'t you remember? You came to the brain-switching ceremony.\\nCarll\": Because I wanted to get back together with my wife, who was sleeping with Carl at the time.\\nLenny: Turns out she had switched brains with a monkey on a Japanese game show. And it just got weirder from there.\\nCarll\": I found it quite normal. Anyway, if you\\'re looking for your Dad. He took the kids to see his Dad.\\nBart_Simpson: Thanks. (DASHES OUT)\\nLennyy\": Hey Moe, get me another beer!\\nCarl: Quit makin\\' me fat!\\n\\n\\nCarl_Carlson: Is it a little weird how much he cries?\\nLenny_Leonard: No way. When a guy who loves America cries, it makes him super straight!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (TIPSY) Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer.\\nHomer_Simpson: I am sitting here... zero sheets to the wind... (SNEAKY CHUCKLE)\\nHomer_Simpson: (HOMER VOICE, BUT DIGNIFIED) ...counting the moments to closing time when I can stumble home to you. Another round, Moe. Uh-oh. Did I type that? (PANICKY) Delete! Delete! (THOUGHTFUL) Hm, typing \"delete\" does not delete.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: ...and that\\'s why I really don\\'t believe there\\'s a God. Thank you, and God bless America.\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: (ANNOYED) You were only supposed to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well I\\'m pretty sure it was in there somewhere.\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: Now, let me conclude by thanking Moe the Bartender for hosting this meeting while City Hall is fumigated for bedbugs.\\nNed_Flanders: (PUZZLED) Bedbugs? Just why is there a bed in City Hall?\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: Er, uh, meeting adjourned!\\nLenny_Leonard: This is so convenient! I can go straight from doin\\' my civic duty to having a beer with my best friend Carl!\\nDuffman: And I can toss back a Duff Sangre de los Muertos with my best friend: Mexican Duffman!\\nMexican_Duffman: (\"OH YEAH\"!) Ho-la!\\nCarl_Carlson: Hey Moe, who\\'s your best friend?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Uh...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well... uh... well, I just made friends with Pepto-Bismol on Facebook and uh... um... (CHANGING SUBJECT) Hey, would ya look at that? There\\'s a spot on the bar!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Come on! (INTENSE SCRUBBING NOISES)\\nLenny_Leonard: You know what? I think Moe\\'s best friend is really that bar rag!\\nBart_Simpson: (HARDY LAUGH) That\\'s even sadder than being friends with Milhouse!\\nMilhouse_Van_Houten: (STARTS TO CHUCKLE, THEN, UNHAPPY) Y\\'know something, Bart? I\\'m getting tired of things like that.\\nBart_Simpson: Tired of what? I dump on you, and you take it -- that\\'s how friendship works.\\nMilhouse_Van_Houten: Not anymore. (ICE COLD) Friendship over.\\nMilhouse_Van_Houten: Taxi!\\nBart_Simpson: What gives? He\\'s not crawlin\\' back.\\nLisa_Simpson: Even a kid who wears a \"Finding Nemo\" back brace has some pride. You went too far this time, Bart.\\nSadistic_Barfly: Hey, Moe! I got a job here for your \"best friend,\" the bar rag.\\nThe_Rich_Texan: Me too! (LAUGHS)\\nHomer_Simpson: Witty. (CHUCKLES)\\nLenny_Leonard: Great meeting though.\\nBar_Rag: Yes, that\\'s right, everyone laugh at the rag. (DRAMATIC, \"KING LEAR\") But I was not always this be-stainèd swatch you see before you. Oh no, gentles. We begin in early medieval France...\\nBar_Rag: (VERY SELF-SATISFIED) That tapestry was me.\\nSponge: Right, and I was the Gutenberg Bible.\\nBartholomé: Maman, we have failed to grow.\\nLise: We\\'ve had too little food!\\nMarguerite: (ANNOYED) Is it too little food or too much complaining?\\nLise: Maman, you are overstressed. You need a vacation. Perhaps to the South of France.\\nMarguerite: We\\'re in the South of France!\\nBar_Rag: (PLEASED NOISE) Well, that helps.\\nBar_Rag: So to recap: I had been unjustly torn from my lofty perch.\\nBar_Rag: I wound up as a barter in Persia...\\nLenny_Leonard: Y\\'know, Moe, it might be time to buy a new bar rag.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, yeah, sure thing, I\\'ll get right on it.\\nMoe_Szyslak: No way I would abandon you, Raggie.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EMOTIONAL SOB) You\\'re my best friend.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, I guess you didn\\'t eat that \"special cheese\" that I gave you yesterday, huh? (CHUCKLES)\\nBar_Rag: My degradation continued.\\nBar_Rag: An enterprising seamstress turned me into the flag of a fledgling nation.\\nBar_Rag: Unfortunately, a nation on the wrong side of history.\\nBar_Rag: (SIGHS) And now my thousand-year fall from grace is complete. I guess I should be happy here, with my sad, but predictable...\\nBar_Rag: (STARTLED NOISES) Moe! Moe! Wake up! Oh no, I don\\'t want to find out what\\'s worse than you!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: So you guys have any luck finding a new job?\\nLenny_Leonard: Does it look like I\\'ve got a job?\\nCarl_Carlson: No, I didn\\'t.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer, show a little more sensitivity around these jobless washouts, huh?\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, I\\'ve gotta tell ya, I\\'m miserable there. I\\'m all alone; and when there\\'s some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?\\nLenny_Leonard: Hey, Homer. You know what I\\'m playing for ya?\\nLenny_Leonard: The World\\'s Smallest Violin. And now I gotta sell it just to make my rent.\\nLenny_Leonard: Oh my God! (WORRIED) Where\\'s the bow? I can\\'t sell it without the bow!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Easy, easy there, Lenny. You can always play it pizzicato.\\nLenny_Leonard: The buyer clearly specified violin and bow!\\nHomer_Simpson: Maybe I should be heading home.\\nLenny_Leonard: (ANGUISHED) Oh no, he stepped on the bow!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Boy, this place has gotten so grim. I\\'m gonna do something I\\'ve never done: make myself a drink.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (ARGUING WITH HIMSELF) You call this beer? This is watered-down swill! You got a problem? Well here\\'s the complaint department!\\nMoe_Szyslak: You know what I think, Moe? I think You ain\\'t got the guts!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Missed!\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, Homer. I could hear your pathetic rationalizing through the door.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, why can\\'t I hang out at the bar all day? My wife doesn\\'t wanna be with me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Look, I\\'d love to discuss your problems but a pack of raccoons took over my back room and today\\'s the day I make my stand.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (STRUGGLING NOISES, THEN) There\\'s more than I thought!\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, you know, in this town, you learn to adjust to things. Runaway monorails... NASCAR star Jeff Gordon...\\nJeff_Gordon: Hey, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey. Bet we never see him again.\\nBarney_Gumble: I\\'m gonna call it a day, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, hey, hey, hey! That plank\\'s only for comin\\' in!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (GENTLY) Try to land on the other traitors.\\nChief_Wiggum: People of Springfield, please be cool like Lou.\\nLou: Yo.\\nChief_Wiggum: We will eliminate one eyesore with another, by bulldozing our tire fire right into the sinkhole.\\nMarge_Simpson: But my car is down there!\\nMayor_Joe_Quimby: For the first time my administration has solved a problem. The hole has been filled by the thing it fears most: stuff!\\nMarge_Simpson: I can\\'t believe we\\'re never going to have another child... (SNIFFLES)\\nLenny_Leonard: Is everything okay over here?\\nHomer_Simpson: Sorry guys. Private family moment.\\nMarge_Simpson: (TIPSY) No, s\\'okay. We can share this with you... Homer can\\'t make a baby because he nuked his swimmers.\\nLenny_Leonard: (SYMPATHETIC) Aw, that\\'s a shame.\\nCarl_Carlson: (NODS) Yeah. That\\'s why I wrap my plums in tin foil every day.\\nHomer_Simpson: (PHILOSOPHIC) Eh, nothing we can do.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, Homer... what if you got back one of those samples you sold years ago at the Shelbyville Sperm Bank?\\nMarge_Simpson: (STUNNED) You never told me about that.\\nHomer_Simpson: (ADMITTING) It\\'s true... that\\'s how I got the money to buy you your necklace.\\nMarge_Simpson: Awww... (THEN) Eww... (REALIZING) Homie! We still have a chance!\\nHomer_Simpson: I, uh, hope it\\'s twins!\\n\\n\\nCarl_Carlson: So, uh, what are you gonna do with the money, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa.\\nLenny_Leonard: So where\\'s the money now?\\nHomer_Simpson: I put it in the bank. That place is great! On their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up.\\nCarl_Carlson: Uh, Homer, we all wanna walk on the beach with our pants rolled up, but, uh, banks are not as safe as they used to be.\\nLenny_Leonard: Yeah, when you give the bank your money, they lend it to other people! I saw a Sesame Street about it! Kermit was wearing his trench coat and everything!\\nHomer_Simpson: Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too?\\nLenny_Leonard: All the frogs on that show are Kermit. Keeps all the other frog actors out of work.\\nHomer_Simpson: That settles it. No banks for me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'ll tell you where you should put your money. The one safe place left in this world of woe:\\nHomer_Simpson: What the--? I\\'m not gonna gamble with my daughter\\'s future.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Nah, you don\\'t have to bet the money. The poker website just keeps it nice and safe, where the FDIC can\\'t get its grubby little hands on it!\\nHomer_Simpson: A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don\\'t you badmouth this country. Compared to the rest of the third world, we\\'re doin\\' great!\\n\\n\\nLenny_Leonard: So you\\'re saying you\\'d rather do the prettiest dude in the world rather than the ugliest broad?\\nCarl_Carlson: Absolutely. But how did we get here from discussing Aristotle\\'s Poetics?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, well, if it isn\\'t Mr. \"Work Comes Before Bowling.\"\\nHomer_Simpson: (TO DAN) I am turning my back, because I can\\'t stand to look you in the face.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EXPLAINING) Part of my new rice wine promotion.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, now you think you can just waltz in here and buy everybody a beer?\\nDan_Gillick: I didn\\'t say that I would...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (CUTTING HIM OFF) Too late, already poured.\\nDan_Gillick: (SIGHS) Sorry guys -- I got the kind of job that you just can\\'t play hooky from.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, I have no idea what you do or who you work with, but I am sure if you put your foot down on their throats and grind until you hear a crunch, they\\'ll sit up straight.\\nDan_Gillick: Really? You\\'re sure about this?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, hey, listen, I\\'ve learned a lot about human nature by watching things through secret cameras.\\nDan_Gillick: Uh-huh. All right, then. Okay, we\\'ll see about that bread dipping. Thank you. Thank you for giving me an attitude. Thank you for giving me an edge.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Or maybe it\\'s groveling that works. Eh, six of one.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s wrong, Homer? You\\'ve got an expression on your face I ain\\'t never seen before. Like one of them Charlie Brown wiggle-frowns.\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'m in an abusive relationship with life. It keeps beating the hell out of me, and I\\'m too cowardly to leave it. (SIGHS) Maybe I could drink myself to death.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, well, you can\\'t. Your tolerance is too high.\\nDejected_Barfly: (A LITTLE SLURRED) Man, I\\'ve never seen Homer looking this bad.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (LOOKING AT HOMER) You\\'re right. He needs some professional help...\\nDuffman: Ooh, someone is down in the Duff!\\nHomer_Simpson: (SAD) Life is too fragile. One minute you\\'re lying in your hammock drinkin\\' beer, the next thing you know you\\'re sittin\\' here drinkin\\' beer.\\nDuffman: Homer, your bleak outlook has sent a smooth, icy chill down... (DROPPING CHARACTER) Screw it, I quit.\\nDuffman: (TO DUFF GIRLS) Janette, Cheryl, get your own ride home.\\nHomer_Simpson: Aw, come on Chief, I\\'ve had a rotten day. Can\\'t you help me out?\\nChief_Wiggum: Sorry, I\\'m afraid the most I can do is pretend to drive you home. (À LA IMPROV COMIC) Okay, now hop on my imaginary motorcycle... arms around my belly...\\nChief_Wiggum: (MOTORCYCLE NOISES) ...um, I\\'m gonna need you to chip in for gas...\\nChief_Wiggum: (THREATENING) This is where the pretending ends.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Here ya go, Homer. Boy, y\\'know, when you\\'re just here alone, I can really smell ya.\\nHomer_Simpson: But I\\'m not alone. I\\'m doing some Face Time with Lenny.\\nLenny_Leonard: It\\'s like I\\'m skydiving with all my friends! Lemme text Carl.\\nMoe_Szyslak: So, uh, what are you pullin\\' the ripcord with?\\nLenny_Leonard: Uh-oh. Maybe there\\'s a ripcord app I can use.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Huh. Looks like you\\'re really turning somethin\\' over in your mind there, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I\\'m choosin\\' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Here you go. Duff Adequate.\\nHomer_Simpson: To hope! (DRINKS HAPPILY)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Wow, no one\\'s ever been happy in this place before. And when I started it was Moe\\'s Ice Cream Carnival. Not good.\\nKent_Brockman: A hundred dollar bill for anyone who will give me the truth behind this so-called miracle tree.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'ll take your money. The tree\\'s a fraud.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (VERY HAPPY) I just got a hundred! The tree is real! (TO BROCKMAN) What you got against hope, anyway?\\nBarney_Gumble: I bet something disillusioned you as a child.\\n7-Year-Old_Brockman: This is junior reporter Kenny Brockelstein investigating the stories that kids want to know...\\n7-Year-Old_Brockman: (YOUNG, BUT SERIOUS) Mr. Mouse, how come you haven\\'t been in any funny cartoons since nineteen thirty-three?\\nShort_Man: (GRUFF) I\\'m on a break, kid. And when I\\'m on a break, the mouse is dead.\\nKent_Brockman: (MUTTERING) The mouse was a man. His teeth were yellow, his breath was rancid, my innocence was lost in a plywood castle.\\nBarney_Gumble: The castle is plywood? (UPSET NOISE)\\nMan_With_Tree_Hat: It was all a hoax!\\nTree_Hoper: Let\\'s burn our hats!\\nCrowd: Hope is dead! Burn our hats!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Thank God there\\'s no alcohol in this bar or this place would really go up.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (GASPS) What happened here?\\nMoe_Szyslak: I don\\'t know. Everything crappy about this place they like! Even the rats!\\nPretentious_Rat_Lover: More manchego, Aziz?\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (SADLY) I guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show.\\nLloyd: My friend, you just experienced W.R.O.L. first hand.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (MAD) Hey, hey! Read the sign, pal.\\nMoe_Szyslak: \"No acronyms!\" (TO BARFLIES) And that goes for the rest of you, too!\\nLarry: Okay, okay.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (PULLS OUT SHOTGUN) In this bar we say \"Old Kinderhook!\"\\nLenny_Leonard: (TO LLOYD) What\\'s W.R.O.L.?\\nLloyd: It means \"without the rule of law.\" Anarchy. The end of civilization. Coming soon to an America near you.\\nHomer_Simpson: America can\\'t collapse! We\\'re as powerful as ancient Rome!\\nLloyd: Take a look at this.\\nNarrator: The modern world. An inexorable march of progress.\\nHomer_Simpson: Sweet.\\nNarrator: (OMINOUS) Or is it?\\nDr._Eugene_Blatz: We\\'re slaves to the system. Close the supermarket, and we starve. Cut off the tap, we drink our cat\\'s blood.\\nNarrator: Who will survive in this new world?\\nNarrator: The man who is prepared.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh my God! This unsourced, undated video has convinced me beyond any doubt!\\nLloyd: (CLOSES PHONE) And I\\'m the guy you wanna know when the stuff hits the fan.\\nCarl_Carlson: Hey, man. No need to almost swear.\\nLloyd: Come with me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, Homer\\'s gone. Let\\'s all go into our suspended state till he gets back.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, in my case my Mom was hit with a voodoo curse, I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire.\\nBart_Simpson: (SKEPTICAL) Really?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (NODS) Keep my tail right here in this jar.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Good times.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Acquitted?! Then my nightmare isn\\'t over? (SOBS)\\n\\n\\nMarge_Simpson: (HOPEFUL) In-ground?\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOANS) Moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with \"f\"?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, you know, it\\'s funny you should mention that. I\\'ve been readin\\' that \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and it turns out that what chicks want now is a guy to give \\'em what-for in the bedroom there.\\nHomer_Simpson: Woo hoo! I\\'ll woo her with woo-hoo!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah y\\'know, if this is what women like, I should be a lot more popular. But it does inspire me to work on my fan fiction.\\nMoe_Szyslak: \"Sheriff Andy took Barney in his arms and kissed him deeply, then said: (IMITATING ANDY GRIFFITH, BUT STERN) \\'now if Aunt Bee asks, we were down at the fishin\\' hole\\'.\" (MOE VOICE) I can\\'t be the only one who likes this.\\n\\n\\nCarl_Carlson: Wooden!\\nLenny_Leonard: Plastic!\\nCarl_Carlson: Wooden!\\nLenny_Leonard: Plastic!\\nCarl_Carlson: (FRUSTRATED) Why do we always argue over coffee stirrers?\\nRev._Hooper: You know what\\'s really stirring? Live local theater.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Before I let a Holy Joe walk in this bar, I\\'ve gotta know which of the two true faiths you represent.\\nRev._Hooper: Well, I represent an easy-going offshoot of Protestantism.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (PULLS OUT A SHOTGUN) That is the wrong thing to say to a snake handler.\\nLenny_Leonard: Easy Moe, easy!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, this thing\\'s just loaded with rock salt. I just use it to keep raccoons outta my fridge. And of course to coat the rims of my margarita glasses.\\nHomer_Simpson: Padre, can I be honest with you? I\\'ve sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn\\'t.\\nHomer_Simpson: And if it\\'s such a (AIR QUOTES) \"Good Book,\" how come there\\'s no blurbs on the back? Not even David Sedaris? And he\\'ll flack anything!\\nHomer_Simpson: Seriously, \"Pews?\"\\nRev._Hooper: Homer, I love your passion. It\\'s terrific, it\\'s really something. Listen -- I\\'m just thinking -- would you consider being my deacon?\\nHomer_Simpson: Deacon? (SUSPICIOUS) Is that like one of those weird Catholic Priest things?\\nRev._Hooper: No, not at all. It\\'s like a sexton, or a rector.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, now we\\'re talkin\\'. But why me?\\nRev._Hooper: Because if I can get the man who sleeps through church to be my guy, this town will know that religion can be fun.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well I\\'m not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the snow plow business, \"I\\'m your astronaut\"!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: ...so I stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.\\nHomer_Simpson: Nothin\\'s gonna delete these!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SERIOUS, SAD) Guys, there\\'s somethin\\' I wanna tell ya. Somethin\\' important.\\nLenny_Leonard: (MID-CONVERSATION) So who do you like, the Padres or the Tigers? I\\'m not talkin\\' about baseball, I\\'m asking if a priest can beat a big cat in a death match in some kind of polygon.\\nCarl_Carlson: Hexa- or octa-?\\nLenny_Leonard: Only one way to decide: arm wrestling.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SADLY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF) Who am I kiddin\\'? They don\\'t care about me.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Suicide. Finally. I\\'m really doin\\' it. No more cries for (LOUDLY) helllp! (NORMAL) \\'Cause this time there\\'s no one that\\'s gonna (LOUD) save me! (NORMAL) I mean, it\\'s not like (LOUD) I\\'m beggin\\' ya, please, please show me some love! (QUIET) Yeah, it\\'s nothin\\' like that. (SMALL SOB)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, maybe I should call. Give one of the new kids a chance to talk to the legend.\\nWarm_Female_Voice: Hello, you have reached the Buzz Cola Suicide Hotline.\\nWarm_Female_Voice: (RECORDED) Our options have changed, so please listen carefully.\\nWarm_Female_Voice: State the reason you are committing suicide.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (THOUGHTFUL) Nothin\\' to live for.\\nWarm_Female_Voice: You said, \"business problems.\" Is that correct?\\nMoe_Szyslak: No! I got nothin\\' and no one!\\nWarm_Female_Voice: You said, \"face sucked off by vacuum cleaner.\" Is that correct?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SOBS) No! No! Help me! Help!\\nWarm_Female_Voice: If your face is in the vacuum cleaner bag, press \"one.\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: I just wanna talk to a human being!\\nWarm_Female_Voice: Please hold for our next available life-extension agent.\\nMale_Singers: SUICIDE IS PAINLESS / IT BRINGS ON MANY CHANGES / AND I CAN--\\nMoe_Szyslak: That tears it! No more delays!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (VULNERABLE) Hello?\\nBart_Simpson: Hi, I\\'m looking for a Mister Ron -- first name Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Moe-ron? (REALIZING) Moron! It\\'s you, you little puke... I am gonna tie a rope around your neck and hang-- (CHOKING NOISES)\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'ll show you who\\'s a... (DYING) moron.\\nLenny_Leonard: ...and that\\'s why libraries use newspaper rods.\\nHomer_Simpson: I know C.P.R.\\nHomer_Simpson: I took a class where you do chest compressions to a Bee Gees song.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SINGING/PUSHING) HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE... HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE...\\nLenny_Leonard: Are you sure it wasn\\'t \"Stayin\\' Alive?\"\\nHomer_Simpson: Too on the nose. (SINGING) I REALLY NEED TO LEARN / \\'CAUSE WE\\'RE LIVING IN A WORLD OF FOOLS...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SINGING) BREAKING US DOWN...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SINGING) WHEN THEY ALL SHOULD LET US BE... WE BELONG TO YOU AND ME...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SINGS) I BELIEVE IN YOUSE... (SITS UP) you guys, you saved me! You do care!\\nHomer_Simpson: Now wait a minute. Gotta make sure you\\'re okay. Who\\'s the president now?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Some jerk.\\nHomer_Simpson: He\\'s back!\\nMoe_Szyslak: And I really wanna thank you all. You gave me a new lease on life, and I\\'m gonna take this opportunity to...\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SIGHS) What\\'s the point?... same ol\\' stinkin\\' world... ah, this post-suicide afterglow gets shorter every time!\\nMarge_Simpson: Homer Simpson!\\nHomer_Simpson: (TERRIFIED NOISE) The woman I love!\\nMarge_Simpson: I sent you to the store to get applesauce for Maggie two hours ago!\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, uh, I was just leaving, but Moe... had an accident.\\nMarge_Simpson: What kind of accident?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (EMBARRASSED) I... uh... may have tried to end it all. Wasn\\'t even good at that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Excuse me, will you? (CHOKED-UP NOISE)\\nMarge_Simpson: That poor man. We\\'ve got to do something to change his life.\\nLenny_Leonard: We could write on his face when he passes out.\\nCarl_Carlson: (CHUCKLE) That\\'s always good for a laugh.\\nMarge_Simpson: No, no, it has to be something big that\\'ll change his whole outlook. (SNAPS FINGERS) Why don\\'t we take Moe on a road trip?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (REENTERING) Oh, that, hey, that\\'s really sweet. Hey, can Noosey come too?\\nMarge_Simpson: (GENTLY) Moe, this trip is about turning your life around.\\nLenny_Leonard: With the three desperate barflies that you see every day.\\nMarge_Simpson: Maybe I should come too.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Four guys, a chick and a noose. Just like the movies I like to watch.\\nMoe_Szyslak: This dump is too filthy for a man with a positive worldview. I\\'m gonna start cleaning!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (GROWING EXCITEMENT) Dirt... carpet... another layer of dirt... Congoleum... hardwood?!

Come on, you work your butt off in a radioactive hellhole, and what do you get? Not one lousy superpower!\\nHomer_Simpson: I guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what I know... and how I know.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Whoa-ho, bad idea! No, no.

Too much pressure.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, Channel Six tip line? I just caught two senators doin\\' it in the alley. And me? I\\'m just a reliable source. Not \"sauce,\" \"source\"! Source! \"S-A-U-R-C-E\"!\\nKent_Brockman: (TOUCHES EARPIECE) We have heard from a very reliable sauce, news involving multiple senators.\\nKent_Brockman: I will read a list of senators...with possibly more senators...to be named later by other senators:\\nKent_Brockman: Senator Abercrombie, Senator Billingsley, Senator Beaumont...\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh damn, the plaster\\'s flaking again.\\nHomer_Simpson: ...so Marge says I gotta \"ask Lisa on a date.\"\\nLenny_Leonard: Sure you remember how to ask out a girl, Homer?\\nCarl_Carlson: Yeah, you\\'ve been out of the game a long time there.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey guys!

Mom and Pop bartenders can\\'t compete with big box stores like Booze Barn and Hooch City.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Thanks, Cap. Now what I\\'m proposing is a superhero pub crawl. Our clientele dress up in costume and go drinking from bar to bar. Their masks make \\'em feel uninhibited, and invulnerable.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Yeah, and that\\'s not all.

Wish I had that Tom Brady\\'s libido.\\nHomer_Simpson: What is your problem, boy?\\nBart_Simpson: Maybe when I\\'ve got a Dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I don\\'t know, a low bar?\\nHomer_Simpson: Wow. I\\'ve gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts.\\nBart_Simpson: Aren\\'t those full of germs?\\nHomer_Simpson: Eat the nuts!

How\\'re you gonna pay for that?\\nBender: (LYING) Uh... let me just transfer some, uh, electronic hyper-credits into your register here.\\nBender: (CASH REGISTER SOUND) Ding-a-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding! Ooh, and, uh, another round for my friends! Ding-a-ding-ding-a-ding-ding!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, this Blade Rummy is all right! He\\'s a big spender, plus he fixed the jukebox. (GOSSIPY) I think they had a thing going.\\nJUKEBOX_RECORD: (SINGS) OH BABY WHAT YOU DONE TO ME.\\nBender: I hate it when they get quiet.\\nHomer_Simpson: Listen, I-I know you\\'re a robot and incapable of emotion...\\nBender: (HUGE SOBS) It\\'s true!

Are you familiar with the books by my countryman Chinua Achebe, \"Things Fall Apart\" and \"No Longer At Ease?\"\\nMoe_Szyslak: You guys got real optimistic literature there.\\nKEMI: (AMUSED) Fair comment.\\nKEMI: (YAWNS) I haven\\'t eaten all day.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Don\\'t eat those eggs! We don\\'t know what kinda bird they turn into! But there\\'s a string cheese or something in the fridge in the back. Help yourself.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Alright, after she eats, I\\'d better close up. (STRETCHES, YAWNS) C\\'mon, pal.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'s really stuck there good.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (SMALL SMILE, SIGHS) I can\\'t be mad at her no more.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Goodnight, moon.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Goodnight, broom. Good night jukebox that won\\'t play a tune.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Goodnight eggs. Goodnight dregs. Goodnight bugs crawlin\\' up my legs. Goodnight beer. Goodnight mice. Goodnight Princess who treats me nice. Yeah.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, well, look who\\'s up. Princess, I\\'m gonna do something for you I\\'ve never done for anyone in this bar: call you a cab.\\nKEMI: No. I want to spend time with you. I want to see this town.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Do you mind ridin\\' on a cute little scooter with your arms around my waist?\\nKEMI: (SHYLY) I don\\'t.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (LIFTS INDEX FINGER) To the scooter store!\\nMoe_Szyslak: I did not think this through.\\nKEMI: Moe, before I left, I just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved, albeit depressing, literature.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ah, some nice bedtime readin\\'.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Fun premise.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m laughing already.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Really not cheerin\\' me up here, but uh, let me offer you the only literature in this bar. Sure works for me though.\\nMoe_Szyslak: This coaster.\\nKEMI: I will treasure it.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, I guess you\\'ll pine forever for a man who doesn\\'t care, while I just grow old here in this bar.\\nWaylon_Smithers: Here\\'s to suffering in silence.\\nWaylon_Smithers: (INTRIGUED NOISE) Can\\'t wait to see those numbers hanging from my rafters.\\nAGED_MOE: (SIGH) I can\\'t believe it\\'s been three years since Smithers left. Man, have I been aging badly. (SIGHS) But I guess I can finally wash this forehead.\\nAGED_MOE: (SMILES) Divine.\\n\\n\\nTROY: (TIPSY) Homer, I\\'m really touched you invited me out on the town. You\\'re gonna be a four-star brother-in-law.\\nTROY: (DRUNK BUT SMOOTH) C\\'mere, Homer.\\nTROY: I\\'ll let you in on a little secret...\\n\\n\\nYoung_Homer: (TIPSY) Marge, come here.\\nYoung_Homer: Marge, I need both hands for this game. Can you feed me nachos while I play?\\nYoung_Homer: Tell that to the brave crew of the S.S. Triangle.\\nYoung_Homer: Come on! You\\'re always saying we should do things as a couple.\\nYoung_Homer: Oh, this is wonderful. I love you, Atari.\\nYoung_Homer: (OBLIVIOUS) Well, I aims to please. Hey, let\\'s stop by that dumpster and make out. (GAGS, THEN: HOLDS UP FINGER) Hold that thought.\\n\\n\\nTeenage_Homer: Psst, Barney! My Dad\\'s asleep. Want a beer?\\n\\n\\nYoung_Marge: I don\\'t want a life of watching you get drunk, then holding back your long, beautiful hair while you vomit. I have my own dreams and I can\\'t live them with you.\\n\\n\\nTeenage_Homer: I\\'ve got two words for you. Mellow out, man. Hmm? Hmm?\\n\\n\\nTeenage_Bart: (AGHAST) Dad, that\\'s my fourth grade teacher!\\nTeenage_Bart: Hi, Mrs. K. This is sure weird, huh?\\nTeenage_Bart: Uh, I... don\\'t think so.\\nTeenage_Bart: (SIGHS) I wish I could talk to my fourth grade self just once. I\\'d say \"work hard, don\\'t be such a screw up.\"\\n\\n\\nAdult_Bart: Wow, this place hasn\\'t changed a bit.\\nAdult_Bart: Was my Dad here?\\nAdult_Bart: Yeah. Since he don\\'t drink, he just comes here to see Lenny and Carl.\\nAdult_Bart: Hey Lenny.\\nAdult_Bart: Right. What was the point again?\\n\\n\\nHomer\\'s_Brain: Okay, Homer. This is the moment of truth. You\\'ve gotta tell Marge you really don\\'t want another kid.\\nHomer\\'s_Brain: Eh, how bad could it be?\\n\\n\\nKirk_Voice_Milhouse: Hey bartender. We\\'d like two milks and then you can tell us where babies come from.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s the matter, Homer? Somebody leave a lumpa coal in your stocking? You\\'ve been sitting there sucking on a beer all day long.\\nHomer_Simpson: So?\\nMoe_Szyslak: So it\\'s Christmas!\\nHomer_Simpson: (DOWN) Thanks, Moe.\\nBarney_Gumble: Drinks all around!\\nHomer_Simpson: What\\'s with the crazy getup, Barn?\\nBarney_Gumble: I got me a part-time job working as a Santa down at the mall.\\nHomer_Simpson: Wow. Can I do that?\\nBarney_Gumble: I don\\'t know. They\\'re pretty selective. (BURPS)\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: You\\'ll get that punk someday, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ahh, I don\\'t know. He\\'s tough to catch. He keeps changing his name.\\nHomer_Simpson: (Reaches into his pocket) Moe, I think I\\'ll have another -- (opens wallet, sees it is empty) -- Whoops. (checks pockets, pulls inside out) Moe, I\\'m a little low on funds. You think could cover me just this once?\\nMoe_Szyslak: No, sorry.\\nHomer_Simpson: Why not? I think after all these years I deserve an explanation.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I don\\'t think you\\'re ever going to get another job and be able to pay me back.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Don\\'t worry, we\\'re still friends.\\n\\n\\nBOXING_ANNOUNCER: The fans are getting just a little bit anxious here folks...\\nHomer_Simpson: (SAD) Another beer, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s the matter, Homer? Bloodiest fight of the year, and you\\'re sittin\\' there like a thirsty bump on a log.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eddie.\\nEddie: Evening, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Want some pretzels?\\nEddie: (CHUCKLE) No, thanks. We\\'re on duty. Couple beers would be nice, though.\\nMoe_Szyslak: That\\'ll be two bucks, boys. Just kidding!\\nLou: Good one, Moe. Hey listen, we\\'re looking for a family of Peeping Toms that has been terrorizing the neighborhood.\\nLou: (TO DOG) Quiet, boy. Let the nice people enjoy their beers. Uh, don\\'t worry. This dog has the scent.\\nEddie: Hey! What\\'s gotten into Bobo?\\nHomer_Simpson: (NERVOUS) I\\'ve got some wieners in my pocket.\\nEddie: That figures. Come on, you stupid dog.\\nHomer_Simpson: You know, Moe, my Mom once said something that really stuck with me. She said, \"Homer, you\\'re a big disappointment,\" and, God bless her soul, she was really onto something.\\nBarney_Gumble: Don\\'t blame yourself, Homer. You got dealt a bad hand. You got crummy little kids that nobody can control.\\nHomer_Simpson: You can\\'t talk that way about my kids. Or, at least two of them.\\nBarney_Gumble: Why? You got two I haven\\'t met?\\nHomer_Simpson: Why, you... Here\\'s five you haven\\'t met.\\nBOXING_ANNOUNCER: And a tremendous right! That\\'s just got to hurt! Ladies and gentlemen, this fight is over!\\nTV-STATION_ANNOUNCER: (FROM TV) All-Star Boxing is brought to you by \"Dr. Marvin Monroe\\'s Family Therapy Center\".\\nHomer_Simpson: (COMING TO) Huh... what?\\nTv_Wife: (FROM TV) Honey, aren\\'t you going to work today?\\nTv_Husband: (FROM TV) No, I don\\'t think so.\\nTv_Wife: (FROM TV) Honey, you have a problem. And it won\\'t get better till you admit it.\\nTv_Husband: (FROM TV) I admit this: You better shut your big yap.\\nTv_Wife: (FROM TV) Oh you, shut up.\\nTv_Husband: (FROM TV) No, you shut up.\\nTv_Wife: (FROM TV) No, you shut up.\\nTv_Husband: (FROM TV) Oh, Shut up!\\nTv_Wife: (FROM TV) Shut up!\\nTv_Husband: (FROM TV) Shut up!\\nSmall_Boy: (FROM TV; CALMLY) Why don\\'t you both (FURIOUSLY) shut up!\\nDr._Marvin_Monroe: (from tv) Hi, friends. I\\'m Dr. Marvin Monroe. Does this scene look familiar? If so, I can help. No gimmicks, no pills, no fad diets. Just family bliss, or double your money back. So call today!\\nAnnouncer: (FROM TV) Dr. Marvin Monroe\\'s Family Therapy Center. 1-800-555-HUGS. Why don\\'t you call... Right now?\\nHomer_Simpson: When will I learn? The answers to life\\'s problems aren\\'t at the bottom of a bottle. Heh-heh. They\\'re on TV!\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Yeah! Moe\\'s Tavern. Moe speaking.\\nBart_Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Is Jacques there?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Who?\\nBart_Simpson: (THRU PHONE) Jacques. Last name Strap.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hold on. (CALLS OUT) Uh..Jacques Strap! Hey, guys, I\\'m looking for a Jacques Strap!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) What -- oh! Wait a minute -- Jacques Strap? It\\'s you, isn\\'t it? You cowardly little runt. When I get hold of you I am gonna gut you like a fish and drink your blood.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, come on, come on everybody. We\\'ve got to get on with our lives. Let\\'s try and put this tragedy behind us.\\nBarney_Gumble: You\\'re right, Moe. A beer, please, and make sure there\\'s a head on it.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Ohhhh. (BEGINS SOBBING)\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: Wow!\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: What\\'s the matter, Homer? Hottest Ladies Night in months and you\\'re not even checking out the action.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, Moe. My wife gave me the old heave-ho because of some lousy picture.\\nMoe_Szyslak: This one?\\nBarney_Gumble: So where you staying tonight, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: Motel, I guess.\\nBarney_Gumble: Oh, no. No pal of mine is gonna stay in some dingy flophouse.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: Phone call for Al. Al Koholic. Is there an Al Koholic here?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Wait a minute... (GRABBING PHONE) Listen, you little yellow-belly rat jackass, if I ever find out who you are, I\\'ll kill ya! (HANGS UP)\\nHomer_Simpson: I hope you do find that punk someday, Moe. Fill \\'er up.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Is everything okay, Homer? Usually you have a quick one, some peanuts, a hunka beef jerky, a couple pickled eggs and you\\'re outta here.\\nHomer_Simpson: Let\\'s just say, I don\\'t feel like goin\\' home tonight. Jar, please.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Hey, you can level with me. You got a domestic situation?\\nHomer_Simpson: (CONTEMPLATES HIS EGG, THEN JAMS IT IN MOUTH) You might say that. My wife\\'s gonna leave me \\'cause she thinks I\\'m a pig.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) What?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Marge is right. You are a pig. You can ask anyone in this bar.\\nHomer_Simpson: What? (YELLS) Hey, Barney, am I a pig?\\nBarney_Gumble: (DRUNKENLY) You\\'re no more of a pig than I am. (BURP)\\nHomer_Simpson: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, no.\\nMoe_Szyslak: See? You\\'re a pig. Barney\\'s a pig. Larry\\'s a pig. We\\'re all pigs. Except for one difference. Once in a while, we can crawl out of the slop, hose ourselves off, and act like human beings. Homer, buy your wife some flowers and take her out for a night on the town. Candles, tablecloth, the whole nine yards.\\nHomer_Simpson: Gee, a romantic evening. Nah, she\\'s too smart to fall for that.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I\\'m not done. (LEANS IN) After dinner, the two of you are going to check into the fanciest motel in town, and not check out until the next morning. If you get my drift.\\nHomer_Simpson: I read you loud and clear.\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Good morning, Moe\\'s Tavern!\\nBarney_Gumble: Ah... it\\'s the President!\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: (RE: TV) Oh, no. An election! That\\'s one of those deals where they close the bars, isn\\'t it?\\nMoe_Szyslak: (NODS) Sorry, Barney.\\nBarney_Gumble: Wow! Super fish!\\nMoe_Szyslak: I wish the government would get off his back.\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: So, Homer. What happened in Capitol City?\\nHomer_Simpson: Aw, Barney.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Come on, Homer. We\\'re dyin\\' of curiosity.\\nHomer_Simpson: Look, there\\'s only one thing worse than being a loser. It\\'s being one of those guys who sits in a bar telling the story of how he became a loser. And I never want that to happen to me.\\nBarney_Gumble: Please, Homer.\\nMoe_Szyslak: C\\'mom, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, okay. It all started on \"Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night,\" down at Springfield stadium.\\nHomer_Simpson: This was the biggest decision the Simpsons ever faced. I should\\'ve listened to the kids instead of my big dumb wife.\\nHomer_Simpson: I shouldn\\'t have called her that. Bite my tongue. Bite my tongue. (BITES TONGUE) Oooh.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SIGHS) So that\\'s it. The costume\\'s buried now. As my son would say, I\\'m one sad ape-like dude.\\nBarney_Gumble: Wow.\\nMoe_Szyslak: What a saga.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I\\'ve become the center of attention.\\nBarney_Gumble: Yeah, it\\'s riveting. (BURP)\\nMoe_Szyslak: Tell it again, Homer.\\nHomer_Simpson: Okay. I wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I don\\'t know. They just do.\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: But I only got up to go to the can.\\nHomer_Simpson: Rasputin\\'s got the reach, but on the other hand, the Professor\\'s got his patented coma lock. If you ask me, this is gonna be one hell of a match.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, look at that show-off... kissing his own muscles. (YELLING) Boo!\\nBarney_Gumble: (TO THE TV) Boo! (BURPS)\\nHomer_Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Hey, I don\\'t see your name engraved on the bar stool.\\nRichard: ...one...two...three...four...\\nAudience: (FROM TV) ...five... six...\\nBarflies: ...seven...eight... nine... ten... eleven...\\nTV_Announcer: (FROM TV) The ref is issuing a warning to Rasputin.\\nTV_Announcer: (FROM TV) Oh, my. Oh, my. Why is the referee permitting this?\\n\\n\\nSmitty: You better be dyin\\'!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: Well, that\\'s it. I guess this is the class I\\'m gonna die in.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Eh, you\\'re better off. Rich people aren\\'t happy. From the day they\\'re born, to the day they die, they think they\\'re happy but, trust me... they ain\\'t.\\nHomer_Simpson: (THINKING) Moe, I wish he\\'d shut up.\\nLarry: Look, a chick!\\nMoe_Szyslak: And it\\'s not even Ladies Night.\\nHomer_Simpson: Hey, hey, guys. Knock it off. It\\'s just my wife.\\nMarge_Simpson: (WITH THE ABOVE) My name is Marge. (TO HOMER)\\nMarge_Simpson: Homer, I\\'d like you to forgive me for doing the right thing.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, Marge...\\nMarge_Simpson: We\\'ve squabbled over money before -- never this much -- I mean, I know this is different than that time I washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but I--\\nHomer_Simpson: (WITH TROUBLE) No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it\\'s not. It\\'s worse, Marge. I\\'m afraid that from now on when I look at you, I\\'m not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I\\'m just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance.\\nMarge_Simpson: What are you saying, Homer?\\nHomer_Simpson: I\\'m saying... (THINKING) She\\'s been your wife for ten years, you\\'ve had three children together, it\\'s time to be honest with her. (TO MARGE) I\\'m not sure I love you anymore.\\nHomer_Simpson: But don\\'t worry. I\\'ll never let on. I\\'ll still do all the bed stuff. Maybe it won\\'t be so bad.\\nMarge_Simpson: Oh my Lord. Well, I don\\'t want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out.\\nMarge_Simpson: Homer, look at me.\\nHomer_Simpson: Alright, alright, look at her if it\\'ll make her shut up. Start with the feet, still angry? Good, good Homer, good. This is tough, need refreshment. Ahh, good old trustworthy beer, my love for you will never die. Alright, alright, gotta look the wife straight in the eyes and tell her.\\nHomer_Simpson: Oh, who am I kidding? I love you more than ever.\\nMarge_Simpson: I love you too!\\nHomer_Simpson: Sorry to scare you like that, babe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Okay, everybody! For the next fifteen minutes, one third off on every pitcher... one per customer... domestic beer only... hey, no sharing!\\n\\n\\nHomer_Simpson: I gotta call Marge.\\nBarney_Gumble: Ha!\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Moe\\'s Tavern -- birthplace of the Rob Roy.\\nMoe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Just a sec. (CALLING OUT TO ROOM) Hey, is there a Butts here? Seymour Butts? Hey, everybody. I wanna Seymour Butts!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, wait a minute. (INTO PHONE) Listen, you little scum-sucking pus-bucket. When I get my hands on you, I\\'m gonna pull out your eyeballs with a corkscrew.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SADLY) Oh, it was busy. Moe, another last beer, please.\\nHomer_Simpson: (SNIFFLES) Guys, keep it down. I got some last words. I never told you this before, but sometimes when I\\'m at work, I think of you and smile. So often I think that ... oh, words won\\'t do it. (TO MOE) I love you, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Please, not in public.\\nHomer_Simpson: I love you, Barney.\\nBarney_Gumble: Oh, how European. (BURPS)\\nHomer_Simpson: (SCREAMS) Come on, Barney, I gotta get home. (ON THE RUN)\\n\\n\\nBarney_Gumble: So, Homer, I hear you got the fight.\\nHomer_Simpson: Yeah, that\\'s right. Eight o\\'clock, my place. Come one, come all.\\nBarney_Gumble: Hey, Moe, how come you never got cable for the bar?\\nMoe_Szyslak: Well, it was either cable or the mechanical bull.\\nMoe_Szyslak: I made my choice and I stand by it.\\n\\n\\nMoe_Szyslak: (BEAT) Just a minute, let me check. (TO THE BAR) Homer Sexual. Come on, come on. One of you guys must be Homer Sexual!\\nMoe_Szyslak: Oh, sorry Principal Skinner. It must be a bad connection. (TO HOMER) It\\'s for you. I think Bart\\'s in trouble again.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Lighten up, Homer. You\\'re making Happy Hour bitterly ironic.\\nHomer_Simpson: Ah, Moe. I\\'ve gotta find a date for my big, fat, snotty sister-in-law, Selma.\\nBarney_Gumble: I\\'m intrigued. What does this Selma look like?\\nHomer_Simpson: (HOPEFUL) Like my wife\\'s ugly sister.\\nBarney_Gumble: Wheel her in, Homer. I\\'m not a picky man. (BURP)\\nBarney_Gumble: And then when I got out of the service, well, the next few years are a blur.\\nSelma_Bouvier: Patty. Where\\'s Skinner?\\nPatty_Bouvier: We decided we loved each other enough never to see each other again!\\nSelma_Bouvier: I hope I can find a man like that. (THINKS A BEAT) Patty, are you throwing away your last chance at happiness just for me?\\nPatty_Bouvier: Yes.\\nSelma_Bouvier: Thanks.\\nPatty_Bouvier: Now let\\'s get some pancakes.\\nSelma_Bouvier: Listen Barney, I... (DISDAINFUL) Eh.\\nBarney_Gumble: She broke my heart, Moe.\\nMoe_Szyslak: Don\\'t worry, Barney. Time heals all wounds.\\nBarney_Gumble: Well, what do you know. You\\'re right! And look, a whole pitcher to myself.'"
